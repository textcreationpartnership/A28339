            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this day of the Lords Controverſie, a Cup of trembling hath been put into your hands, and you have drank deep of it: Such Slaughters rarely, if ever, have been within your Walls ſince their Foundations were firſt laid. The memorable year of <hi>Twenty Five,</hi> muſt not be compar'd with <hi>Sixty Five,</hi> either for the number of the Slain, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Viſitation, or ſuch unwonted reiterated Increaſes and Decreaſes: And O that ſuitable to the dread of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, Effects might be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all your Hearts! that the Lord may be pacified towards you, and may not add to this Plague ſeven other and worſe Plagues. You are now comforting your
<pb facs="tcp:41272:3"/>Hearts with thoughts that <hi>the bitterneſs of Death is paſt;</hi> your Trade will return, and the Cloud that hath darkened your glory and ſplendor will vaniſh: To which I heartily ſay, <hi>Amen;</hi> the Lord do ſo. But if I thought it would be born, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, I would take leave to tell you, I have my fears; fears not bottom'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Apoſtles expreſſion is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. <hi>profane and old Wives fables;</hi> but upon Conſiderations (as I judge) more ſolid: An account of which, be pleaſed to take in a few words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Cities every way famous have had their Periods: all worldly glory carrieth decaying Principles in its bowels. It may, as the Sun, go forth in its beauty and ſtrength until it climb to its Meridian and thenceforward it will decline until its lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre ſet in obſcurity. As they ſay of the World, ſo of Cities, they have their <hi>Youth</hi> and <hi>Manhood,</hi> in which they are in their ſtrength and vigour; and after that, <hi>Old Age,</hi> until they return to the duſt out of which they were raiſed. <hi>Tyre,</hi> a City of ſtrength, called <hi>the ſtrong City,</hi> Joſh. 19.29.
<pb facs="tcp:41272:3"/>an ancient and enriching City; yet from the Lord went forth a Commandment to deſtroy it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.11. <hi>Babylon,</hi> once the Metropolis of a mighty Empire, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſtood upon ſuitable advantage-ground for its ſecurity; yet could not bear up it ſelf againſt that Sentence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt take up this Proverb againſt the King of Babylon, and ſay, How hath the Oppreſſor ceaſed? the golden City ceaſed?</hi> Ceaſed to <hi>be,</hi> as well as to <hi>oppreſs:</hi> It is the deſtiny of ſome, that when they ceaſe to <hi>oppreſs,</hi> they muſt ceaſe to <hi>be</hi> alſo. <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the beloved City, honour'd by the King of Heaven (that Fountain of all true Honour) againſt her cries the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Jeruſalem is ruined, and Judah is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi> God commands and threatneth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Tyrus,</hi> Ezek. 26.4. <hi>Break down her Towers; I will alſo ſcrape her duſt from her, and leave her like the top of a Rock:</hi> not ſo much as any Monument ſhould remain. <hi>Jamſeges eſt ubi Troja fuit.</hi> Others their memory is periſhed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Thou haſt deſtroyed Cities, their memorial is periſhed with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:41272:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sins &amp; great Provocations have been precedaneous unto, and the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Cauſes of the ruine of Cities. God is known to be long-ſuffering to all among whom he is known; he doth not ſtrike, much leſs deſtroy, without a cauſe, nor yet for every cauſe: God can bear long, yet will he not bear always. Wickedneſs may in places of eminency, as Diſeaſes in the Body, lurk up and down for a ſeaſon, till by continuance they grow ſtrong, ſeiz the Vitals, and down goes the Houſe of Clay. Sin drowned the old World, and burnt <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> and they are left upon record, as Examples of Divine Vengeance, to put a reſtraint upon the exorbitancies of ſinful Cities. Every pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſin of Cities, as they are a Body and Community, or the ſin of them that are the viſible owned authority in them, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſuch, is a ſtroke at their Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and many ſuch may ſoon level them with the ground. There are Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks of decaies &amp; approaching <hi>Death,</hi> not onely in the Natural, but in Bodies Politick alſo. The Death-Marks upon
<pb facs="tcp:41272:4"/>Cities of old, have been ſuch as theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Pride: <hi>God reſiſteth the Proud,</hi> is true concerning a <hi>Nation, City,</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi> It it was <hi>Moabs</hi> height that laid him low: <hi>We have heard of the pride of Moab, he is exceeding proud; therefore ſhall Moab howl, for the foundations of Kirhareſeth ſhall ye mourn,</hi> Iſa. 16.6. <hi>Tyrus</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Beauty,</hi> Ezek. 27.3. thence was ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, and brought to nothing.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Foeliciſſima—</l>
               <l>Dicta foret—ſi non ſibi viſa fuiſſet.</l>
            </q>
            <p n="2">2. Oppreſſion; eſpecially oppreſſion and cruelty towards the Lords own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>Wo to the oppreſſing City,</hi> Zeph. 3.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.21. <hi>With violence ſhall that great City Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all:</hi> and why ſo? that follows, verſ. 24. <hi>In her was found the Blood of Prophets, and of Saints, and of all that were ſlain upon the Earth.</hi> God will make inquiſition for Blood, eſpecially for the Bloood of his <hi>Abels,</hi> that will cry; all that have had their hands in it, call themſelves by what name of diſtinction they will, will be found to be Brats of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and they
<pb facs="tcp:41272:5"/>and their Cities may fall thereby. One of the great Sins that came up into remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance againſt <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zidon,</hi> was this, <hi>The Children of Judah and the Children of Jeruſalem have ye ſold to the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border,</hi> Joel 3.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Treachery and Unfaithfulneſs: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 1.9. <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; becauſe they dilivered up the whole Captivity of Edom, and remembred not the Brotherly Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Falſe-Worſhip: <hi>Jer.</hi> 19.11. <hi>I will break this City as one breaketh a Potters Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel that cannot be made whole again; and they ſhall bury in Tophet till there be no place.</hi> In <hi>Tophet</hi> they ſinned in their corrupt Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and there they muſt fall by this their iniquity. Certainly wo to them who after Light received, and ſolemn Covenants made, dare to corrupt the Worſhip of God, and defile the Sanctuary with their deteſtable things; wo to them, whether Perſons or Places.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The baſeneſs of pretended ſpiritual
<pb facs="tcp:41272:5"/>men: There is a wo againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Zeph. 3.1. and why? <hi>Her Prophets are light and treacherous Perſons; her Prieſts have polluted the Sanctuary, they have done violence to the Law:</hi> HER Prophets and Prieſts, ſaith God, not MINE; ſome of their own making: they do wickedly, and would wreſt the the Word, and labor to make it ſpeak for their abominations.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Contempt of the Goſpel: This evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently was <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> undoing; <hi>They kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Prophets, and ſtoned them that were ſent unto them;</hi> and upon a ſuppoſition and hope to preſerve their worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, they ſet themſelves againſt Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.48. <hi>If we let him thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, all men will believe on him, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans will come and take away our Place and Nation.</hi> This their deſign proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; that which they intended for the promoting of their carnal ends, let in the Enemy upon them like a flood, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruine of them and their City. Never yet did any ſell a Goſpel to gain a Trade, but ran an eminent hazard of ſelling themſelves into ruine and miſery.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:41272:6"/>
            <p n="7">7. Incorrigibleneſs: <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſcum went not out of her, as the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains: <hi>A fire was kindled under her;</hi> ſhe was in diſtreſs, but yet ſin was not purged out: She received not correction, as it is expreſſed, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.1. Judgments are Gods laſt Remedy, if they do no good, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt die, without a miracle of <hi>mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sins have been the ruine of Cities, by their turning God to be againſt them: So long as a <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> can ſay, <hi>The LORD is with us,</hi> they ſtand firm. <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Perſons, Cities,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> if they ſell or forfeit their <hi>Rock,</hi> he will alſo ſell them, or <hi>give them into the hands of ſpoilers.</hi> A <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> that <hi>God</hi> has wrought for, muſt not ſuppoſe the preſence and care of <hi>God</hi> ſo entaild upon them, that he will ſtand by them, be it right or wrong. If they turn their backs upon <hi>God,</hi> caſt off the thing that is good, ſerve their luſts, ſeek themſelves, ſcoff at Holineſs, tread his People in the dirt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert all Equity and Right, call evil good, and good evil, put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs; <hi>God</hi> will alſo turn <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41272:6"/>againſt ſuch, and fight againſt them as an Enemy: Wo to them that have God againſt them! <hi>Wo unto them when I depart from them,</hi> ſaith <hi>God,</hi> Hoſ. 9.12. <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>'s doom was, <hi>Saith the Lord God, behold I, even I, am againſt thee, and will execute Judgements in the midſt of thee.</hi> It is a great vanity in ſome, who when they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked <hi>God</hi> to his face, and done evil even to the uttermoſt they can, do imagine the breach may be repair'd with a little feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Humiliation, upon whom that Text looks very ſadly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.12. <hi>When they faſt, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer Burnt Offering and an Oblation, I will not accept them: but I will conſume them,</hi> &amp;c. Sometimes <hi>God</hi> is ſo turned againſt <hi>Cities,</hi> that he will not accept of the mediation of his <hi>People</hi> for them, and this was the caſe in the Text but now cited, v. 11. God ſaith to <hi>Jeremiah, Pray not thou for this People.</hi> God, when turned againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ezekiel, Son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody City:</hi> ſome render it, <hi>An cauſam ageres, an cauſam ageres Civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis iſtius?</hi> Wilt thou plead for that City?
<pb facs="tcp:41272:7"/>No, ſaith God, thou ſhalt not ſet upon ſuch loſt labour. <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> can ſometimes onely deliver their own Souls. <hi>God Almighty</hi> keep his <hi>Noahs, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels, Jobs,</hi> whatever may be the lot of others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is no fence againſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Diſpleaſure; nothing can be a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to that place againſt which God is turned. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was once ſuppoſed to be impregnable; hence when <hi>David</hi> went to take it, they ſet the <hi>blind and lame to keep</hi> it, as a Guard conceived ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from all Aſſaults; yet was it trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down, when God armed an Enemy againſt it. <hi>Tyrus</hi> was waſted in the day of <hi>Gods diſpleaſure,</hi> although rich and ſtrong in Shiping, and what elſe might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the ſtrength of a place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> God wants not ways to lay Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties low, if his Mind be engaged againſt them: He may poſſibly not do it all at once, but he can do it <hi>gradatim,</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: He ſaith of <hi>Tyrus, Bring it out piece by piece, Ezek.</hi> 24.6. The remains after one Judgement, he can take off by another;
<pb facs="tcp:41272:7"/>What ſurvives the Peſtilence, may fall by the Sword and Famine.</p>
            <p>And great is the Equity of God in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus with <hi>Cities</hi> and places of <hi>eminency.</hi> They are the Heads from whence other places receive influence. If ſin abound in Cities, it is from them proppagated tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all places that have commerce with them, or depend upon them. It is ſaid of <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 17.1. <hi>The Kings of the Earth and Inhabitants of the Earth have been made to drink of the wine of her fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should you now put the queſtion to me, that the People once did to <hi>Ezekiel, Wilt thou tell us what theſe things are to us?</hi> My Anſwer is, Be you faithful to your ſelves, and compare your ſelves with what I have laid before you, and ſo may you come to inform your ſelves how far theſe things concern you. What your ſins are, you know, or may know: You have been and yet are under the Rod. Under your Glory a burning is kindled, I wiſh it may be extinct ere it conſume both Root and Branch.</p>
            <p>Three things there are, that ſpeak for
<pb facs="tcp:41272:8"/>you; I wiſh they may out-cry your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are many among you in whom the Lord takes pleaſure, however they are by ſome lightly eſteemed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You have been a Refuge to the Needy in their diſtreſs: What day you ceaſe ſo to be, you will augment my fears, and perhaps your dangers alſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some among you have lately with chearfulneſs received the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, your Rowers have brought you into <hi>Great Waters,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27.26.

            <p>APologies for appearing in publick are ſo common, and ſometimes ſo full of vanity, that they create ſuſpitions of Pride and Vain-glory in the ſpirits of men, rather then remove ſuch ſtones of ſtumbling: I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave my integrity in this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking to Him whoſe prerogative it is to try the ſpirits.

            <p>My deſign in the whole is to ſpeak ſomething, that Saints may know their Duty, being eſcaped; and to bear up their hearts under the ſad thoughts of paſt, and what future ſlaughters may be: and to commend Saintſhip to Sinners, that they may be deſirous to get into that number. I have avoided affected ſtrains and Jingles, that ſound of words, (which in my apprehenſion are but dead flies, that corrupt the Boxes of otherwiſe precious Oyntment) that the deſign may be heeded more then the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and have ſought to ſpeak ſomething that may be ſuitable to every caſe.

               <q>In that day ſhall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the Fruit of the Earth ſhall be excellent and comely, for them that are eſcaped of Iſrael.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat you may have a little light into theſe words, it will be expedient to conſider two things: 1. What we are to underſtand by the <hi>Branch of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the fruit of the Earth;</hi> and 2ly. To what Time and what Perſons theſe words do relate. As for the former, you ſhall find in Scripture
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41272:10"/>there is one who is called <hi>the Branch,</hi> Zac. 6.12. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, ſaying, Behold the man whoſe name is the BRANCH;</hi> and <hi>Zac.</hi> 3.8. <hi>For behold, I will bring forth my Servant the Branch:</hi> in theſe Scriptures, and alſo in the Scripture I am upon, by <hi>Branch</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Jeſus Chriſt; and that we are to take Chriſt to be thereby intended, is evident from <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6. <hi>Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto David a righteous Branch, and a King ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgement and Juſtice in the Earth; in his days Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely, and this is his Name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah our Righteouſneſs:</hi> He that is <hi>the Lord our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> is this <hi>Branch,</hi> and that is certainly the Lord Jeſus: He is called <hi>the Branch of the Lord</hi> upon the account of his Divine Nature, that he is the Son of God, the onely begotten of the Father, that lay in his Boſom from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; as alſo becauſe he was a Branch growing out and appearing in his glory and ſplendour, before the Sons of Men, by the appointment and Decree of the Father.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Fruit of the Earth,</hi> who may that be? You find ſometimes in Scripture, Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>a Rod out of the Stem of Jeſſe, and a Branch growing out of his Roots,</hi> Iſa. 11.1. <hi>And there ſhall come forth a Rod out of the Stem
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41272:10"/>of Jeſſe, and a Branch ſhall grow out of his Roots;</hi> He is ſo called upon account of his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as he is Man, he is of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> and upon the ſame ſcore he is here termed the <hi>Fruit of the Earth;</hi> Chriſt, the Branch of the Lord, as he is Man, is of earthly extract and Original; Man is of the Earth, and Chriſt as Man, is made of the ſame mould with the reſt of the Children of Men; he was made Man, and being of the Seed of the Woman, he is here called <hi>the Fruit of the Earth.</hi> Thus much for anſwer to the firſt Enquiry, Who is meant by the <hi>Branch of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the Fruit of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To what Time and Perſons do theſe Words refer? For there is a certain time unto which theſe words have relation; <hi>in That day;</hi> in what day is that? it is a day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a day of great calamity; for it refers unto the end of the foregoing Chapter without all diſpute: in the 25 and 26 Verſes it is ſaid, <hi>Thy men ſhall fall by the Sword, and thy mighty in the war, and her Gates ſhall lament, and ſhe being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate ſhall ſit upon the ground:</hi> it relates to a time when much ſlaughter ſhould be made, ſlaughter to a deſolation, when men ſhould be exceedingly weeded out of the Earth, then <hi>ſhall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and the Fruit of the Earth excellent and comely.</hi> If that be the iſſue of Deſolation, we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41272:11"/>need the leſs matter it. But unto what Perſons doth this word relate? I anſwer primarily, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jewiſh People, and unto thoſe among them that ſhould ſurvive and out-live the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities that do befall them; it relates unto the ſurviving People among the Jews: <hi>The Branch of the Lord ſhall be beautiful and glorious, and the Fruit of the Earth excellent and comely, for them that eſcape,</hi> and them that eſcape of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> It relates, ſecondarily (I ſuppoſe) and may indifferently have ſome reſpect to all the People of God; or more largely, to all thoſe unto whom the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhall come, and they be thereby prevailed upon: as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Scripture was a name unto all the Jewiſh Nation unto whom the Oracles of God were committed, and they owned a ſubjection to them; ſo it may have reſpect unto all in all times of the Goſpel, brought over to Chriſt, who falling under ſore Calamities, have this grace allowed them, to ſurvive and out-live thoſe days of diſtreſs. This may ſerve to give light into the words; and two Truths I would note from them, which lie fairly in them, and which I judge as pertinent unto the preſent circumſtances under which we fall, as any in any one Scripture that I know of in the Book of God.</p>
            <p>Doctr. 1. <hi>That it is a proper iſſue and a good effect of ſlaughtering-Judgement, upon them that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41272:11"/>have eſcaped the ſlaughter, to have Chriſt become glorious and excellent unto them.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the iſſue of all thoſe dreadful deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgements that ſhall break forth in the world, ſhall be the putting of glory upon the head of Chriſt, and that glory upon Chriſt ſhall be to the good and benefit of thoſe of Iſrael that ſhall eſcape the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="doctrine">
               <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt, namely, <hi>That it is a good iſſue of Slaughtering-Judgements, upon them that out-live ſuch calamities, that Chriſt is become glorious and excellent in their accounts:</hi> The Words do certainly relate to a Time of great ſlaughter, ſuch a ſlaughter that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which was once a very populous City) and the places of the greateſt concourſe in it, which were the Gates (for in the Gates Juſtice was executed, and thither was a confluence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from all parts) but ſuch ſhould be the ſlaughter that her Gates ſhould lament, and mourn, and become deſolate; at this time there were ſome ſhould eſcape, (God uſeth to have a remaining Remnant when his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is at higheſt) and what ſhould this ſad Judgement work upon them that ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main? The Branch of the Lord ſhould become glorious among them: You read in the 78 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> verſ. 34, 35. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned, and enquired early after God, and they remembred that God was their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41272:12"/>Rock, and the high God their Redeemer: When he ſlew them,</hi> that is, when he came forth with ſlaughtering Judgements, as he did ſometimes againſt <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and particularly, God ſmote them with Plagues more then once: now what did they that remained and were left alive do? they began to have more high and awful thoughts of the Lord then before, the eſteem of him was a little raiſed in their hearts; <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred he was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer;</hi> thus far they went well, onely that which followeth ſpoiled all; in verſ. 36, 37. <hi>Nevertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues; for their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant:</hi> if really the eſteem of the Lord had been raiſed in their hearts, they had been an excellent People, and the Lords Judgements had wrought kindly. You ſhall find the Lord complains for the want of ſuch a ſpirit in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.7. God called there to the People, and how? He called by mercy; <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, with the bands of love,</hi> verſ. 4. that is, I treated them kindly; he called them by Judgements, as you ſee in verſ. 6. <hi>The Sword ſhall abide on his Cities, and ſhall conſume his Branches, and devour them;</hi> what did God expect ſhould be the anſwer unto his Call, and the fruit of all his Diſpenſations? it was that they ſhould have exalted him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41272:12"/>him, and admired him at a greater rate then before? but becauſe they did not, God took it ill, and reckoned that his Providences had not a kindly reception among them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Yet</hi> (ſays he) <hi>have I ſet my King upon my holy Hill of Sion;</hi> which words are not onely a Prophecy concerning that Kingdom Chriſt ſhall have, but declarative of that Kingdom he hath, <hi>viz.</hi> his Providential Kingdom, by which he manages and governs affairs in the World; now in the management of it what doth he do? ſometimes, as in verſ. 9. he <hi>rules them with a Rod of Iron, and daſhes in pieces like a Potters Veſſel;</hi> but what ſhould they do that ſhould out-live ſuch Providences? you ſhall ſee the Fruit that ſhould grow upon this Root, <hi>Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way;</hi> Chriſt expects when he is abroad with his Iron Rod, and daſhing Earthen Veſſels to pieces, as he hath this day, they that ſtand on their feet not daſhed to pieces, as others of the ſame mould, he expects higher thoughts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to be more eſteemed by them; and if he fail of his expectation, let them remember that they are but Clay, and therefore in the way, not out of danger. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.50. <hi>Ye that have eſcaped the Sword, go away, ſtand not ſtill; remember the Lord afar off, and let Jeruſalem come into your mind:</hi> God was abroad with the Sword, it may be the material Sword, and it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41272:13"/>may be with ſuch a Sword of the Angel as he hath lately been cutting withall; what ſhould the Eſcaped do? Remember the Lord: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him, you will ſay, what is that? Give me leave to open it unto you a little, becauſe I ſhall uſe the term again anon; To <hi>remember the Lord,</hi> implies two things among others:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To have the heart wrought up into the fear of the Lord, to ſanctifie his Name; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath, to keep it holy;</hi> that is, ſanctifie the Sabbath: ſo remember the Lord, that is, fear him, let his Name be great, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be dear unto thee. <hi>Remember thy Creator;</hi> what is that? it is, Give up thy ſelf unto the Lord, remember who he is, and what he is, and what he calls for from thee: when a People ſin againſt the Lord, they are ſaid to <hi>forget</hi> him many times; ſo ſuitably to <hi>remember</hi> him, is to fear him, to honour him, and lift up his Name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>remember the Lord,</hi> is to love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him, to have a great eſteem of him; as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? is he a pleaſant Child? ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him:</hi> Gods remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring <hi>Ephraim,</hi> was his love to and delight in <hi>Ephraim;</hi> ſo our remembring the Lord, is our loving of and delighting in him: and this is the frame that ſhould be found upon the hearts of them that eſcape ſore Calamities, To fear and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41272:13"/>magnifie, to love and delight in him: This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a right Spirit, and it is called for elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. <hi>And they that eſcape of you ſhall remember me among the Nations whither they ſhall be carried Captives:</hi> Time was when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had few and ſlight thoughts of God their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, but when GOD had been at work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them by ſevere ſtrokes, thoſe that did eſcape of them, their Spirits ſhould be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, much altered for the better; they ſhould come and love him and fear him, ſo as they did not before: So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.20. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day;</hi> what day was that? a day of great ſlaughter: for, verſ. 19. <hi>The reſt of the Trees of his Forreſt ſhall be few, that a Child may write them;</hi> a Child that is but a bad A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetician ſhould be able to number them that ſhould remain, the ſmallneſs of them ſhould be ſuch: <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, that the Remnant of Iſrael, and ſuch as are eſcaped of the houſe of Jacob, ſhall no more again ſtay upon him that ſmote them, but ſhall ſtay upon the Lord, the holy One of Iſrael in truth:</hi> ſtaying upon the Lord, is an Act of Faith, and Acts of Faith do greatly glorifie Chriſt, and ſpeak the Heart much delighted in him; if thou be'ſt not taken with him, thou wilt never act Faith upon him: But this was the Fruit that this eſcaping Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould bring forth, and is that which God expects from <hi>preſerved ones</hi> in a day of <hi>ſlaughter.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41272:14"/>
               <p>All this confirms the Truth I have been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at; and in the proſecution of it, I ſhall propoſe two things to be ſpoken to:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhow what Engagement there lieth upon them that eſcape in a day of ſlaughter, to be thereby led unto an eſteem of Chriſt; why it ſhould render this <hi>Branch of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Fruit of the Earth,</hi> beautiful and glorious in their eyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When thoſe that do eſcape may conclude their eſcaping hath this iſſue and effect upon their Souls. And</p>
               <p n="3">3. Try what Improvement we may make of this Truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, How doth our eſcaping in a time of Calamity, lay an engagement upon the heart to prize and value Chriſt the more? I ſuppoſe it is very natural; I would evidence it in four or five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt hath the management of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, and ſurely then of ſuch as theſe; a Sword goeth not thorow a Land, nor a Plague thorow a City, Country, or Town, but Chriſt hath a great hand in it: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.35. <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand;</hi> the Father out of his great love unto his Son, and confidence he hath in him, that he will do nothing but what is well, hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the management of all Providences into his hands; he hath given him the power of life
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41272:14"/>and death in the World, and where he will he ſpares, and where he will he ſlayes: the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God (repreſented under the notion of the two Witneſſes) it is ſaid of them, that they have a kinde of power to kill People as they will, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Theſe</hi> (meaning the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) <hi>have power to ſhut Heaven, that it rain not in the days of their Prophecy, and have power over Waters, to turn them into Blood, and to ſmite the Earth with Plagues as often as they will;</hi> but their power is but in a way of Prayer; through the great intereſt they have in the Lord, and his Chriſt, they can do much, and carry a great ſtroke for or againſt a People: But now the power of Chriſt is abſolute, he can do and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in this matter as he pleaſeth; and why hath he this power? look <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgement unto the Son:</hi> by <hi>judging</hi> here, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, Ruling and Government, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſpoſing of things in the World, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, which the Father doth not do without, but by the Son; the matter is left unto him, and why? <hi>That all men might honour the Son even as they honour the Father;</hi> therefore is this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment committed unto the Branch of the Lord, that it might gain him the more eſteem: We that have ſeen ſo much of Chriſt in theſe his Diſpenſations, ought it not to have this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon our <hi>hearts,</hi> to teach us to <hi>honour the Son as we honour the Father?</hi> Eſpecially,</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41272:15"/>
               <p n="2">2. Conſidering, That that Eſcape which you and I have in a day of Calamity, it is through the Son; if thou do'ſt eſcape, this Branch of the Lord hath a great hand in it; however we may rob Chriſt of his honour, and attribute it unto ſecond Cauſes, yet indeed and in truth, the matter is in Chriſts hand: You read of a Retiring-Chamber for the People of God in days of Calamity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Come my People, enter into your Chamber, and ſhut the doors about you, hide your ſelves for a little moment, until my indignation be over-paſt:</hi> Are there Retiring-Chambers in the day of Gods Controverſie, when he comes to contend, and ſmite down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth? I might ask the queſtion, Where are they? and ſay as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 139.7, <hi>&amp;c. Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit, or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence? if I aſcend up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thou art there; if I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there; if I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt parts of the Sea, even there ſhall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand ſhall hold me:</hi> where may a man be hid in the day of Gods anger? I would ſay, Retire into Chriſt, he is a Rock of ſhelter, he is the <hi>Munition</hi> of <hi>Rocks</hi> where the Soul ſhall be hid, it is the man Chriſt Jeſus ſhall be a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert from the ſtorm, a hiding place in the day of diſtreſs,</hi> ſuitable unto which the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.7. <hi>Thou art my hiding-place, thou
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41272:15"/>ſhalt preſerve me from trouble, thou ſhalt compaſs me about with Songs of Deliverance:</hi> Soul, art thou preſerved? it is Chriſt hath been thy hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place. There were ſome in the days of <hi>David</hi>'s Calamity ſcoffed at him, and bid him <hi>flee as a Bird unto his Mountain;</hi> but ſee what he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.1. <hi>In the Lord I put my truſt, how ſay ye to my Soul, Flee as a Bird to your Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?</hi> It was a Pſalm penn'd in the time when he fled from <hi>Saul</hi> (as I conceive) and it is as if he ſhould ſay, It is true, I have recourſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unto this and that Mountain, and I do go up and down from place to place to be hid from the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> but I go as God leads me, as Chriſt goes before me; and where-ever I am, and which way ſo ever I look, it is the Lord is my Refuge, from him I expect my ſecurity. You read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.26. of <hi>a Throne, and upon the Throne there was one like unto a man;</hi> that Man was the Man Chriſt Jeſus; the Throne upon which he ſat, is the Throne of his Providential Kingdom, where he ſits and governs all things in the World, and where he ſits to order all the matters in the following part of this Prophecy. Now ſee what he doth upon this Throne of his; <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him,</hi> (that is, the Man cloathed with Linen, that had the Writers Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn by his ſide) <hi>Go through the midſt of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and ſet a mark upon the foreheads of the men that ſigh, and that cry for all the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41272:16"/>that be done in the midſt thereof; and to the others he ſaid, Go ye after him through the City, and ſmite, let not your eye ſpare, neither have ye pity: ſlay utterly, old and young, both maids and little children, and women, but come not near any upon whom is the mark,</hi> &amp;c. I gather hence that it is Chriſt hath the marking men for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or preſervation: he upon the Throne of his Providential Kingdom, governs and orders for preſerving or deſtroying in a day of ſlaughter; therefore if thou art kept, know who hath been thy Keeper. This was typified in the Caſe of <hi>Aaron,</hi> in that ſore Plague, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.46, &amp;c. <hi>And Moſes ſaid unto Aaron, Take a Cenſer, and put fire therein from off the Altar, and put on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and go quickly unto the Congregation, and make an attonement for them, for there is wrath gone out from the Lord, the Plague is begun: and Aaron took as Moſes commanded him, and ran into the midſt of the Congregation, &amp; behold the plague was begun among the People; and he put on Incenſe and made an atonement, and ſtood between the dead and the living, and the Plague was ſtayed. Aaron</hi> he was the High Prieſt, and in that Office a great Type of Chriſt, and in this action a great Type of Chriſt alſo; it is he, by his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and mediation, ſteps in between the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and the Dead; if thou art not fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that fall, it is becauſe this <hi>Aaron</hi> hath ſtept in to thy help, becauſe he hath reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41272:16"/>thee, and been a Preſervation unto thee. The 68th Pſalm is a Pſalm applicable to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> witneſs that paſſage in the 18th verſe, <hi>Thou haſt aſcended up on high, thou haſt led captivity captive, and received Gifts for men, yea, for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell among them;</hi> This, you know, is ſpoken of and applied unto Chriſt by the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> Chap. 4. mark now what follows in this 68th Pſalm, verſ. 26. <hi>He that is our God is the God of Salvation, and unto God the Lord belong the iſſues from death:</hi> This is alſo ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unto him belong the iſſues from death; ſo that if thou art ſpared, and ſaved in a day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is from the Lord, thou muſt ſay thou haſt had this iſſue from death. That which I drive at, is this, (that you may not loſe my deſign) Have you not cauſe, great cauſe, to ſee that the Branch of the Lord by your eſcape be rendered ſo much the more excellent and comely to you, ſince what eſcape you have, is through him? if you are preſerved, it is by Chriſt, unto whom you are beholding for your preſervation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Further, The eſcaping of ſlaughter ſhould render the Lord beautiful and glorious to you, ſeeing it is from him that thou haſt not onely thy Eſcaping, but the Good of thy Eſcape; not onely the Thing it ſelf, but the Mercy with it; by him it is bleſſed unto you, if it be bleſſed. Some there are (and O unhappy they!) unto
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41272:17"/>whom every thing is accurſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. <hi>Let their Table become a ſnare before them, and that which ſhould have been for their welfare, let it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a trap.</hi> Every enjoyment is a ſnare unto ſome; <hi>The curſe of the Lord is in the Houſe of the Wicked,</hi> Prov. 3.33. Some men, though they have houſes to hide their heads in, and it may be many things in them that look like <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> they are yet <hi>curſes</hi> to them; poſſibly their houſes are full of the things of this World, Waters of a full Cup may be rung out unto them, their Eyes may ſtand out with fatneſs, and they may have more then Heart can wiſh; they may have Basket and Store, and yet be curſed both in the Basket and in the Store: it may be their Houſes are full of Children, and the Subſtance they leave is left unto their Babes, as is the Pſalmiſts expreſſion; but they are curſed alſo in the fruit of their Womb: it may be Health and Life are within their Walls, not one ſick, not one dead, all preſerved, and well; but yet it is not well, for this their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is not bleſſed. Let me tell you, that read theſe lines, As God ſmites ſome in anger, in anger alſo ſometimes he forbears to ſmite; therefore in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould you be ſmitten any more?</hi> It was a word of great diſpleaſure: The eſcaping of <hi>ſome</hi> may be curſed unto them; but if thy eſcape be bleſſed unto thee, and thou haſt it, and the mercy with it, thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41272:17"/>unto Chriſt for both: Some are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in love; ſweet is that expreſſion, and happy they that can ſay ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. <hi>Behold for peace I had great bitterneſs, but thou haſt in love to my Soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;</hi> He was not onely <hi>delivered from the pit of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but <hi>delivered in love unto his Soul,</hi> in a way of mercy and ſpecial kindneſs: happy they that can ſay, Thou haſt given me this eſcape in love to my Soul! But how comes a Soul to have ſuch a Deliverance, and to have it in love too? from that general word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. there is the fountain-head from whence our mercies flow, <hi>In thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſſed;</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed (meaning Chriſt) all the Bleſſings come, that come upon the World: Whatever comes to thee or me, if it come as a Bleſſing, it is through the Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and upon that ſcore we are to place it. Now if thou do'ſt eſcape, and this Eſcape be ſanctified unto thee, and all this be but Fruit growing upon this Branch of the Lord, ſhould not thy Eſcape render the Lord Jeſus the more amiable to thy Soul?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thou haſt not onely the mercy of thy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, from Chriſt, but skill to walk under it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comingly; <hi>Vain man would be wiſe, though he is born as the wild Aſſes Colt,</hi> untoward, untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, good for nothing, unruly and perverſe, and if there be any thing of Wiſdom given him, it is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41272:18"/>from this fountain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. it is Chriſt that is <hi>made of God unto us, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption;</hi> it is <hi>in him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge,</hi> and from him communicated and given down unto poor Creatures; as <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 4.12, 13. ſaith, <hi>I know both how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound; every where and in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to ſuffer need; I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me:</hi> that is, I can do all wiſely, I can uſe and manage every Providence rightly: and how canſt thou do this; <hi>Paul? Through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me.</hi> So to uſe Afflictions and Diſtreſſes, Miſeries and Mercies becomingly, thy ſtrength is in Chriſt, and from him it muſt be communicated unto thee; and therefore the ſence of this ſhould much endear Chriſt unto thy Soul, that not only the Mercy of an Eſcape is from him, but alſo Wiſdom to uſe, and rightly to manage it. To which adde,</p>
               <p n="5">5. That by Jeſus Chriſt, this Branch of the Lord, we have not onely an Eſcape in time of common Calamity, but greater and better things, which by our Eſcape we may be led un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conſideration and meditation of: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that through this Branch of the Lord, we have ſalvations of more kinds then one: in that 68th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> verſ. 20. where it is ſaid, <hi>He
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41272:18"/>that is our God is the God of Salvation; Junius</hi> renders it thus, <hi>He is a God powerful to all kindes of Salvation;</hi> or as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>He is the God of Salvations,</hi> in the plural number: So is it with Souls that have really Grace and Mercy from Chriſt, they have Salvations of divers ſorts: they have Salvation from Sin, from that power and dominion that ſin is wont to have in the Soul, they are wonderfully by Chriſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that bondage; and Chriſt had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Name <hi>Jeſus, Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Becauſe he ſhall ſave his People from their ſins:</hi> Though the <hi>Canaanites</hi> may dwell in the Land, they ſhall become tributary, they ſhall not ſit at the Stern turning the Soul which way they pleaſe. Chriſt brings Salvation from Hell, he hath the Key of <hi>David,</hi> that ſhuts and no man openeth, and opens and no man ſhuts; he delivereth from wrath to come, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. Salvation from ſin, and the moſt diſmal iſſues and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, and from a temporal deliverance, the Soul hath occaſion to conſider and think of theſe Salvations. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. I ſuppoſe might be penn'd upon the occaſion of ſome temporal deliverance, for this reaſon, becauſe the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaith in the fourth verſe, The Lord <hi>did heal his diſeaſes, and redeemed his life from deſtruction;</hi> what doth this make the Pſalmiſt think of? in verſ. 3. <hi>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diſeaſes;</hi> it made him think of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41272:19"/>pardoning Grace, and greater Mercy, that he was made partaker of through the Lords boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and goodneſs. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> from his temporal deliverance, was raiſed to think of ſome higher pieces of kindneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. <hi>Thou haſt in love to my Soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption, for thou haſt caſt all my ſins behind my back.</hi> Now if from this Branch of the Lord you have this fruit, not onely of an Eſcape from temporal evil, but freedom alſo from greater; and the eſcape from temporal ones, help to raiſe up the Soul to conſider its intereſt in higher things; then your Eſcape it ſelf ſhould render Chriſt more dear and precious to you then he hath been in times paſt. This therefore may ſerve for the ground of the point, why the Soul ſhould from its Eſcape have higher Thoughts of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I come now to the ſecond thing propounded for proſecution of this Doctrine: When may a poor heart have ſome cauſe to conclude its E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape hath this effect attending it, That it is accompanied with more precious thoughts of this Branch of the Lord?</p>
               <p>I anſwer to it in five things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If in thy Eſcape thou findeſt thy heart more crucified unto the World, that it is gotten out of thy heart beyond what it was, it is to be hoped the Branch of the Lord grows in thy heart, and flouriſheth more then it did. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41272:19"/>it is with the heart of a poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with reſpect to Chriſt and the World, as it is between the Sea and Land; the Sea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times breaks out, and overflows much of the Earth; you can very hardly recover any Land out of the Sea, and be able to fence it out, or if you do, it is at every turn ready to break in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſwallow up all that hath been recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of it: this World breaks in like a Sea, and ſwallows up the hearts of many poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it drinks up their Souls, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Alſo he hath ſet the World in their Hearts;</hi> the World is ſo rooted in them that it over-runs them: Some are called in Scripture <hi>the men of this World,</hi> Pſal. 17.14. <hi>From men of this World, which have their portion in this life;</hi> and they are called the Men of this World, becauſe there is nothing elſe they love and delight in: How hard a thing is it for Chriſt to get ground upon the Heart, ſo as to ſence out this World; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that caſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. when one comes unto Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do to inherit eternal Life?</hi> he bid him at laſt, ver. 22. <hi>Go ſell all thou haſt, and diſtribute unto the Poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven, and come and follow me: and when he heard this, he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorrowful, for he was very rich.</hi> Some of whom it is hoped ſometimes are recovered out of the World, and the World in ſome good meaſure fenced out of their hearts, that one would think
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41272:20"/>there were no great danger of its returning; yet it again breaks in like a torrent, and carries them away, ſo that all their Profeſſion comes to nothing: This World is a Sea that drowns thouſands, thouſands of Profeſſors are by it born down headlong, yet ſome through the power of Chriſt over-come the World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>Who ever is born of God, overcometh the world; and this is the victory we have over the World, even our Faith.</hi> Then the World is ſaid to be overcome, when it is fallen in a mans eſteem and love; when a Soul is convinced what Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry it is, for this World to rule in the heart; for Covetouſneſs is Idolatry; when the Soul comes to ſee that all below is empty, periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and vain, and that that fades in the very uſing, then it is overcome in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Now Soul, if thou canſt ſay that thy Eſcape in the day in which God frowned upon the World, hath made thee ſee all to be vanity and vexation of Spirit, and that thy heart is an entertainment for ſomething more noble, it is to be hoped that Chriſt hath gained upon thee. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.10, 11. <hi>Hearken, O Daughter, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and encline thine ear, forget alſo thine own Kindred and thy Fathers Houſe, ſo ſhall the King greatly deſire thy Beauty; for he is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him.</hi> You muſt not worſhip the World: then you worſhip it, when it hath that place in the Heart that Chriſt ſhould only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41272:20"/>but if the love of this World be rooted out, it is to be hoped that the love unto Chriſt hath expelled it, and the ſight of Chriſt more excellent, hath made thee trample upon theſe terrene objects. It was <hi>Moſes</hi> his ardent love unto Chriſt, that made him <hi>eſteem the reproaches of Chriſt, greater riches then the treaſures of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> Heb. 11.26. It was his value for Chriſt, made him under-value theſe things. I deſire I might reach every of your Conſciences that read theſe lines, if God will own me ſo far, I would urge it upon you; We are yet eſcaped through infinite mercy, hath your eſcaping had this effect, to raiſe up in you higher thoughts of Chriſt than formerly? Can you witneſs it by this evidence? You are poſſibly, ſome of you, thoſe that have had much to do in the World, and concernments of it; if you have not been entangled by it, and found that it hath been very apt to get upon your hearts, I muſt ſay, Either you know not your hearts, or you have ſped much better then moſt in your capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: But can you ſay, It is now turn'd out of doors? that the leaſure-time you have had, hath helped you to look above this Earth, to view things of a more excellent nature; and Chriſts glory hath ſo raviſhed your Souls, that you can ſay that there is nothing that your <hi>ſouls</hi> love above or equal with him? Put it to your Conſciences, I charge it upon you as your duty from the Lord. And,</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:41272:21"/>
               <p n="2">2. If you can ſay, Sin is out of your Heart more then it was, it is to be hoped Chriſt is there; if that be down, Chriſt is ſet up, for theſe ſtand in oppoſition to each other; it muſt be the fall of the one, that muſt raiſe the other: the Diſpenſations of God are directed unto the deſtruction of Sin in the hearts of his People; if he correct, it is a Rod to whip out the Folly bound up in their Hearts: and he hath ſaid that the fruit of ſuch Providences ſhould be the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. <hi>By this ſhall the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his Sin:</hi> If he ſhew kindneſs, it is to deſtroy ſin, to purge that out of the Heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon you, and ye ſhall be clean; from all your filthineſs and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you, a new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and take away the ſtony heart and give you a heart of fleſh.</hi> It relates unto them that ſhould eſcape publick Calamities, which ſhould be attended with the purging away of Sin; and if you can ſay that ſin is fallen in your love, it is to be hoped Chriſt is raiſed. It is between Sin and Chriſt as it was between the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 Sam. 3.1. <hi>There was long war between the Houſe of Saul and the Houſe of David, but David waxed ſtronger and ſtronger, and the Houſe of Saul weaker and weaker;</hi> as the Houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> weakened, ſo the Houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41272:21"/>ſtrengthened; as Sin weakens in the Soul, Chriſt getteth ground: I may ſay of the luſts that are in the Soul, as God ſometimes ſaid concerning <hi>Amalek.</hi> 1 Sam. 15.3. <hi>Go and ſmite Amalek, and utterly deſtroy all that they have, and ſpare them not, but ſlay both Man and Woman, Infant and Suckling, Camel and Aſs:</hi> the Luſts in the heart are deſtined unto utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God would have them killed, and not one ſpared, not an <hi>Agag</hi> left alive. I would put the queſtion unto you, the Lord help you to put it home to your Souls; You that are eſcaped, is all ſlain in your Souls, that is wont to ſtand up againſt Chriſt? is there not an <hi>Agag</hi> ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? I wiſh (if you ſay that Sin is killed) the Lord may not ſay unto you, as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>What then means the bleating of the Sheep, and the lowing of the Oxen in mine ears?</hi> What means that pride, paſſion, earthly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, in the heart of the People of God? if Sin be not brought down, Chriſt is not exalted; if Sin be where it was, Chriſt is where he was; the Branch of the Lord is not made beautiful and glorious, though his kindneſs ſhould have had that effect upon you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you can ſay that are eſcaped, That the Saints are become more precious unto you, it is to be hoped that Chriſt is become ſo alſo: Many Souls have had very precious thoughts of Saints, great eſteem of them, much love for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41272:22"/>them; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.1. <hi>My goodneſs extends not to thee, but unto the Saints, and to the Excellent, in whom is all my delight.</hi> Now love to Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth according as your love to Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth: thou canſt not love a Saint, until thou haſt firſt loved Chriſt; <hi>Col.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Since we heard of your faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and of your love that ye have to all Saints;</hi> love to Saints follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faith in Chriſt. I remember a good Soul, that hath been lately telling me, that this was his conſtant experience, According as my Soul grows in love to Chriſt, ſo it grows in love to Saints: Even as when the Springs grow higher, you may conclude a <hi>fulneſs of water</hi> in the place from whence they are fed; ſo if the Saints are more precious then they were wont to be, he that is the Fountain of all grace, it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, hath let in more of himſelf into thy Soul. Many of you that read theſe things poſſibly have been wont to be the Companions of them that fear the Lord, and have met and converſed with them, but how have they been in your hearts? have they been dear, have they lodged in your Boſom? it may be ſome will complain, Our Souls have not been ſo knit unto them as they ſhould have been; but can you ſay, That fault is ſomewhat amended ſince the Lord hath ſhown you kindneſs, and not onely mark'd you for, but bleſt you with preſerving-mercy?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thou mayſt hope thy Soul is growing in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41272:22"/>its love unto Chriſt, if thou canſt ſay, ſince thy Eſcape thy Soul hungers more after Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him then it was wont to do. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural iſſue of Love is to deſire Enjoyment; and according as thy deſires of enjoyment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt are, ſo is thy love unto Chriſt, of this thou mayſt be confident: Many Souls that go up and down from one Duty to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, have not their hearts inflamed with holy deſires to meet with Chriſt in ways of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore it is ſaid of ſome, <hi>Their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were vain,</hi> that is, becauſe not directed unto their proper ends: The Lord (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5.) hath promiſed that he would <hi>meet with them that rejoyce and work Righteouſneſs, that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Him in their ways:</hi> They that would ſee the Lord, meet with him, and hold fellowſhip with him, they ſhall be delighted in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches unto them. How is thy heart? if the Branch of the Lord be more glorious unto thee, thou wilt more deſire and breathe after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God: Says the Spouſe, <hi>I ſought him whom my Soul loveth.</hi> I hope I write to ſome that know what communion with Chriſt means, it is that that all underſtand not; it is a Riddle to many, I fear to ſome profeſſing Ones: If thou art taught of God, and Chriſt hath to do with thy ſpirit, and thou art really a gainer by thy eſcape, thou doſt encreaſe in longings after communion with Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:41272:23"/>
               <p n="5">5. Hereby it will appear that the Branch of the Lord is become beautiful and glorious unto thee who art eſcaped in this day of Diſtreſs, if there be a great care upon thy heart to be found living up unto every Duty which Chriſt requires and calls for at the hands of them that are eſcaped: every Mercy is a Call to Duty, &amp; lays an obligation upon the heart to ſome Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or other; ſo this eminent Mercy of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in the midſt of ſlaughtering-Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, hath a loud Call from Chriſt, to live in an hearty reſpect unto ſome eſpecial Duties that are enjoyned thee; which are ſuch as theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the requirement of Chriſt, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou art eſcaped a Calamity, thou conſider ſeriouſly, and ſeriouſly lay unto heart, and mourn for whatever provocation might cauſe him to ſhake the Rod over thee; this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the time of our eſcape, as well as our diſtreſs, ſhould make us ſeriouſly to conſider, and having conſidered, to mourn over what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever abominations may have occaſioned the Lord to come forth at ſuch a rate; Scripture hath more then a little to ſay for this, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. <hi>Then ſhall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your Iniquities, and for your abominations.</hi> The time intended here, is the time when they ſhould eſcape Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41272:23"/>that were upon that People, and God ſhould have wrought graciouſly for them, <hi>Then ſhall you remember your Own evil ways,</hi> not others onely, though you may remember others alſo; you may warrantably look abroad, conſider the National ſins and evils, but be ſure thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not thy own; and having remembred, to loath thy ſelf for them, to be offended with thy ſelf, that thou ſhouldſt have any hand in the procuring of any Judgement from the Lord. There is a great miſtake very common, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Practice or Judgement, I will not ſtand to determine; we are not careful to mourn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our miſcarriages, but when the Rod is on our Backs; like Children, while the Rod is on their Backs they will cry and mourn, but when the Father is pacified, then forget wherefore he was contending. The time of your eſcape is to be a time for enquiry into your ways, and mourning over them: look a text or two, one you have <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. <hi>And they that Eſcape of you ſhall remember me among the Nations whither they ſhall be carried captives, becauſe I am broken with their whoriſh heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes which go a whoring after their Idols, and they ſhall loath themſelves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations:</hi> obſerve what Fruit it is the Lord expects from them that are eſcaped; they ſhall remember me, and remember themſelves too,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41272:24"/>their ways and doings, and <hi>then ſhall loath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> to which adde, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Eſcape</hi> they ſhall, but being eſcaped there is a Duty lies upon them, <hi>They ſhould be upon the Mountains as the Doves of the Valleys, every one mourning for his iniquity.</hi> The Babyloniſh Captives after they eſcaped out of Captivity, &amp; out-lived the diſtreſs that had buried many, you find that at that time there was found a ſpirit of mourning upon them; <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.3. is an evident teſtimony of it, <hi>And when I heard this thing, I rent my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and my mantle, and pluckt off the hair of my head and of my beard, and ſat down aſtonied:</hi> thus did <hi>Ezra,</hi> and thus ſhould every one that eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the Day of Gods Controverſie. Now what is the frame of your hearts? truly all our hearing and knowing of what frame we ſhould be in, will ſtand for little, unleſs you compare your Spirits and the Word together, and ſee whether it be with you accordingly: This you may be confident of, we have all had a hand in the provocation of this day, and if ſo, we ſhould have alſo an eye to look into our hearts, and mourn over our evil ways, which muſt be done if we would have a proof unto our ſelves, that this Branch of the Lord is become glorious to us after our eſcape.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord expects of them that eſcape, That they ſhould perform their Vows, make good the Covenant and Promiſes which they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41272:24"/>made in the day when they were in trouble and fear; it is very common with men in a day when diſtreſs is threatned, to make large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and when the diſtreſs is over, to be as backward in performing, as before they were forward in promiſing: this was the caſe of that people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.20. <hi>For of old time I have broken thy Yoke, and burſt thy Bonds, and thou ſaideſt I will not tranſgreſs; when upon every high Hill, and under every green Tree, thou wandereſt, playing the Harlot:</hi> the meaning is, when diſtreſs was upon them they cried, if God would but take off that diſtreſs, and remove the ſtroke, they would be a people not tranſgreſſing, a holy people; but how did they keep the Promiſe? <hi>whenas upon every high Hill, and under every green Tree thou wandereſt, playing the Harlot;</hi> falſified their word abominably; that is a great evil that the Lord cannot well paſs by: that is a known Scripture, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>When thou voweſt a Vow unto God, defer not to pay it, for he hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in fools; pay that which thou haſt vowed: bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, then that thou ſhouldeſt vow and not pay:</hi> in this kind delays are dangerous; <hi>defer not to pay thy Vows, for he hath no pleaſure in folly;</hi> it is folly for a man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto God what he means not to perform; <hi>Better it is not to vow, then having vowed not to pay:</hi> the Devil hath a double deſign upon crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in days of diſtreſs, and our own hearts
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41272:25"/>much deceive us in it: Firſt, I am perſwaded the Devil puts poor Creatures many times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great forwardneſs to make Promiſes, and many times our hearts do exceedingly deceive us by feeding us with ſome ſecret hopes by our Promiſes to buy out an indulgence from the Lord, that we may eſcape the evil we fear: and the ſecond deſign of the Devil is, when he hath brought the Soul to bind it ſelf unto the Lord in abundance of bonds, then to cool the heart as faſt as he can, and make it forget its engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo wraps the Soul in abundance of guilt. I have found that there is no guilt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files the Soul at a greater rate then the breach of Covenant; for God will not endure to be mocked, and have the Promiſes made unto him falſified; God will put your Bonds in ſuit againſt you, and require of you what you have been free to engage for: <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.21. <hi>When thou ſhalt vow a Vow unto the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not ſlack to pay it, for the Lord thy God will ſurely require it of thee;</hi> and it would be ſin in thee, it would be ſin not to live up unto En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. Examine your hearts what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements have you paſſed in the days of your diſtreſs? it may be Viſitations were near you, you were in eminent hazard, and your hearts troubled for fear; did you not ſay, Lord, If thou wilt keep me this day, if I may but out-live this diſtreſs, never will I be ſo vain, ſo earthly,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41272:25"/>ſo carnal, ſo ſlight in the Work of God as I have been? Have you not paſt ſome ſuch or the like promiſe to the great God? Now Jeſus Chriſt he is privy unto all that you have ſaid and done, though it were in ſecret, he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an account of all that you have engaged to be and do; how do you perform? you cannot comfortably conclude that Chriſt hath gotten ground in your hearts, unleſs you have paid your Vows to the Lord. The Servants of God have been conſcientious in the Caſe; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.13. <hi>I will go into thy Houſe with burnt-offerings, I will pay thee my Vows, which my lips have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and my mouth hath ſpoken, when I was in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: David</hi> had his troubles as well as other of his Neighbours, and in his troubles he did ſometimes make Promiſes unto God; herein he was honeſt and faithful, did conſcientiouſly regard the performing the Promiſes he had paſt: and thus to do, will be a proof of your love to, and eſteem of this Branch of the Lord, as more excellent to you, then he was wont to be. Saith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116. <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard my voice, and my ſupplications;</hi> that is, I will love him better then ever I did; if he had but a little, he ſhall now have more; and what proof doth he give of it? verſ. 14. <hi>I will pay my Vows unto the Lord, now in the preſence of all his People:</hi> here was a proof it. The Lord help us that have the Vows of God upon us, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41272:26"/>that Chriſt is become glorious unto us, by performing our Covenant: God is known to be a Covenant-keeping-God, and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be like their heavenly Father. But again,</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third thing required from them that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape a day of Calamity, is this, That Chriſt be owned in the Eſcape, that he have the glory of it; put it not upon your natural Fortitude and Courage, your natural hardineſs and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as ſome vaunting ſpirits are apt to do, and to conclude thence was their preſervation: <hi>God</hi> doth not fear to ſtrike the moſt fearleſs, and ſometimes the moſt fearleſs are in the greateſt danger: Put not thy eſcape upon the ſcore of thy own Wiſdom, that thou haſt acted thus and thus prudently for thy preſervation; if the Lord would, he could eaſily have out-witted thee; and if he had not been with thee in the acting, the beſt of thy Wiſdom would not have been uſeful; take heed of boaſting in Means, if Means have been ſucceſsful, look up to that God that hath been pleaſed to bleſs them unto that end, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.8. <hi>David</hi> puts the matter upon its proper Baſis, <hi>Thou haſt delivered my Soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling:</hi> Gracious hearts deſire to cry as <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, when they ſaw <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Hoſt ſunk as Lead in the Sea, and themſelves preſerved, to their great
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41272:26"/>amazement, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2. <hi>The Lord is my Strength, and my Song, and He is become my Salvation; He is my God, and I will prepare him a Habitation, my Fathers God, and I will exalt him According to this time it ſhall be ſaid</hi> (ſaid <hi>Balaam</hi> in his Prophecy) <hi>What hath the Lord wrought?</hi> This muſt you and I ſay, <hi>What hath the Lord wrought?</hi> The truth is, Chriſt ſuffers much in the World, and ſuffers much from his own People, they rob him of his glory, we are apt to give that honour that is due to him, unto ſome one elſe; but it ſhould be our care to be found in the frame with them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.28. <hi>The voice of them that flee and eſcape out of Babylon, to declare in Sion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his temple:</hi> it is the work of eſcaping Ones to praiſe the Lord, and declare his works: Would you all have ſome token for good, that the intereſt of Chriſt is promoted in you? ſee whether it be your care to give Chriſt the glory of this Salvation, of which you have been partakers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is the requirement of Chriſt from them that are eſcaped, That the ſence of this Mercy ſhould long reſt upon our Spirits: our goodneſs in every reſpect is apt to be like the morning-cloud, and the early dew, that ſoon paſſeth away; and in this reſpect more then in many other things; the ſence of our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41272:27"/>deliverance is very apt to wear off the Soul; but it is a frame that Chriſt much miſlikes, where he findes it; an inſtance or two may ſerve to convince us of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.10, 11. <hi>They kept not the Covenant of God;</hi> poſſibly by this may be intended the Covenants they made with God in diſtreſs, they did not keep them; why not? it was becauſe <hi>they forgot his Works, and Wonders that he had ſhewed them;</hi> and one ſin draws many more after it oft times; they forgot the Works of God, and ſo their Covenant with God, both are taken ill, and the latter as ill as any; that God ſhould ſhew abundance of kindneſs to a People, whilſt they ſlight, and diſ-eſteem, and let the ſence of that kindneſs ſlip out of their minds; and therefore he complains of the ſame thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.13. <hi>They ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat his Works, they waited not for his Counſel:</hi> They were the delivering-Works of God, and all the wonders he had ſhewed them, they ſoon forgot, the ſence thereof was crept out of their hearts in a little time. All of us alive may ſay we have ſeen much of the goodneſs of God to us, but if we ſhould be of the number of them that ſoon forget his goodneſs, we do very evilly requite the Lord.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is the requirement of Chriſt from them that are eſcaped in the day of Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41272:27"/>That we ſhould be dedicated, conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and given up to his Uſe and Service in our whole Courſe: This is the obligation that Chriſt hath laid on our Souls, by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us through the diſtreſſes of this day, <hi>That the reſt of the time we ſpend in the fleſh, ſhould not be ſpent according to the will of the fleſh, but according to the will of God, that the reſt of the time of our ſojourning here, might be ſpent in fear.</hi> It is a kind of a new life that every one of us have received, and this new Life ſhould have Newneſs of Life going along with it: ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God, that you give up your ſelves, Body and Soul, as a Sacrifice to God, which is but your reaſonable ſervice;</hi> and ſuch a mercy as this doth call for it, that your Souls ſhould be for God, and your Bodies for God; the Body hath received a great deal of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at this time, that is preſerved and kept, the Clay-Cottage kept from tumbling to duſt and aſhes; now all the members of the Body, as well as the powers of the Soul, ought to be for the Lord: this the Lord expects, and it is but your <hi>reaſonable ſervice,</hi> which in common Juſtice ſhould be given unto Chriſt: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.8, 9. <hi>For thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered my Soul from death, mine Eyes from tears, and my Feet from falling: I will walk before the Lord in the land of the Living:</hi> that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41272:28"/>is, I will walk as in his ſight and preſence, I will look to maintain a good frame of Life and Converſation in the reſt of the time I have to ſpend in the World: And thus may you teſtifie unto your ſelves and others, that Chriſt gains on you by your Eſcape this day, if you be found in the diſcharge of thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are expected from you. And thus I have diſpatched the Doctrinal part.</p>

                  <p>If this be a proper effect of your Eſcaping in a day of ſlaughter, to have the Branch of the Lord become lovely; know this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath been ſhewed us; therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us narrowly to ſee how this effect is wrought out: Every Soul ſhould turn his Eyes inward, I would hope your Souls have been a little thus engaged; I have not long ſince, met with a People that would eagerly make it their buſineſs to compare themſelves and a Word together, and ſee where their guilt was, and get what light they could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts: this be confident of, the God of Heaven is conſidering diligently, Jeſus Chriſt (this Branch of which we are ſpeaking) is obſerving what is the Fruit of every Mercy; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15. <hi>But Jeſurun waxed fat and kicked; thou art grown thick,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41272:28"/>thou art covered with fatneſs: then he forſook God which made him, and lightly eſteemed the Rock of his Salvation:</hi> when God had done much for him, he conſiders how he had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it, but he found ſad effects of all, <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run waxed fat, and kicked:</hi> I would the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God to us ſhould have ſome more kindly reception, and entertainment. Now that which I ſhall do for the preſent, ſhall not be to clear it up to you that Chriſt hath gotten ground upon you, for as to that, I ſhall refer you to what is ſpoken already, but to lay ſome few things before you, that may convince you, if really you are ſhort and wanting in this bleſſed iſſue af your Eſcape.</p>
                  <p>If really this effect be not wrought upon your hearts, it will appear by theſe four or five things, and I beg you to conſider them ſeriouſly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If in the day when the Rod of God hung more eminently over your heads, you were not conſidering and pondering what effect it ſhould work, and if the Spirit of God were not teaching and inſtructing your Souls, that it was to produce a greater eſteem of Chriſt in your hearts; then I fear it is not done, I fear Chriſt hath no more of you then he was wont to have: You know this, that God with his Correction, is wont to give Inſtruction; therefore ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41272:29"/>(<hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou Chaſteneſt, and Teacheſt out of thy Law:</hi> God is wont to tell the Soul, where it is wanting, what he calls for, and what he would have wrought in the heart: So <hi>Job</hi> 36 9, 10. <hi>Then he ſheweth them their Work, and their Tranſgreſſions, that they have exceeded, he openeth alſo their Ears unto Diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity:</hi> He ſpeaks here about a Day of Affliction, and truly if the Lord hath not been teaching you, and ſhewing you that you were wanting in your eſteem of Chriſt, it is much to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned he is not become glorious. <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 119.67.) ſaid, <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy Word:</hi> how came he to be brought in unto God, to walk with him, and keep his Word and his Way better then he was wont to do? God had been ſhewing him that he was out of the way, and where he ſhould be, and ſo brought him in again. Commune with your own hearts, my Friends, faithfully: have you ſat like Stocks and Stones, under the Viſitations of God, when his Rod was upon others, and threatned you? Had you any of the Viſits of God? Were your Souls exerciſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at a ſpiritual rate? Did God make any approaches unto you? Or did you live in that time without God? If you did, I fear you are without him ſtill.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41272:29"/>
                  <p n="2">2. If your ſouls have not been preſſing after Chriſt, and longing for a better frame towards him, longing for an higher eſteem of him; it is doubtful the eſteem of him is not raiſed in your ſouls: ſuch an eſteem of Chriſt is not a frame that uſeth to ſteal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart, it knows not how; It is for the moſt part the iſſue of much care and pains, and great diligence; and if thy ſoul hath been wanting herein, it is to be feared that the intereſt of Chriſt is not to any great degree promoted in thee: Some ſouls find ſin very apt to creep in do they what they can, and that it is a work, a hard work to keep it down; nor is it leſs difficult to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in our eſteem of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Paul</hi> would know more of Chriſt, and the power of his Reſurrection, what courſe did he take in order to it? ſaith he, <hi>I go forward,</hi> and <hi>I preſs on to the mark, for the price of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> He ſet himſelf unto the work with great diligence. How have you been exerciſing your ſelves? have you been crying unto the Lord in ſecret, wreſtling and pleading with him that he would carry on the Love of his Son in you? What was it you asked of the Lord, was it meerly to be kept from the evil of the day? or that the work of Chriſt might be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in you by your eſcape? If your hearts
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41272:30"/>have not been exerciſed this way, I fear the Branch of the Lord is not become glorious unto you, though you are eſcaped.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If in your Eſcape your great care is how to repair and piece up thoſe outward dammages that you have ſuſtained by this Viſitation, the Intereſt of Chriſt I fear hath not much gained in you; poſſibly many of you may be ſenſible you have ſuſtained out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dammages by this day, if your hearts are only contriving how you may make up thoſe breaches made upon your outward concerns, you are not where you ſhould be: I fear many this day will be like to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Mariners, who after a ſtorm, when a calm comes, they are buſie in patching up their tackling, and repairing the dammages the Veſſel hath ſuſtained by the ſtorm, but not ſo carefull to conſider who hath preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them in the ſtorm, and brought them to a calm: but this is a bad frame; if thou beeſt gained upon by Chriſt, thou wilt ſay, <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his kindneſs?</hi> To which add,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If thy heart in this time of thy Eſcape be not affected w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> that unkind uſage which Chriſt meets with from many eſcaping-ones, I ſhall fear that thou thy ſelf alſo doſt not uſe him kindly, nor prize him much the more though thou haſt an Eſcape from his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41272:30"/>goodneſs; doubtleſs Chriſt meets with much unkindneſs from ſome that have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped. How many in an Atheiſtical ſpirit this day, live as if there were no after-ſtate, nor eternal judgment? as they, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. cry, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall dye;</hi> they have learned to know that Death hangs over their heads, therefore what will they do? why ſerve their luſts as much as they can, make uſe of their time, as they call it, though it be to abuſe time, and turn the grace of God into wantonneſs. Now when thou haſt heard things, how is it with thee? If Chriſt hath gotten ground within thee, theſe things will pierce thine heart. The evil of wicked men is a great grief unto the Saints; therefore it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Righteous Lot was vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked;</hi> his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul was vexed in hearing and ſeeing the diſhonour that was done unto the Lord, it was a burthen to him. And ſo <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wo is me that I ſojourn in Meſech, and dwell in the tents of Kedar;</hi> that is, among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where God is diſhonoured. When thou lookeſt abroad in the World, and ſeeſt how little ſin is born down, and how little the Intereſt of Chriſt is advanced among any that are eſcaped; if thy Eſcape hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Chriſt's Intereſt in thee, this will
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41272:31"/>grieve thy heart; be careful and watchfull in the making a right uſe of this matter.</p>

There is much ſin in it; your ſin ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this, that you have hitherto croſſed the deſign of God by what means you can, the Deſigns of the Lord are very much for the advancement of Chriſt; God ſaith his Son ſhall be exalted and extolled, and made high, and he works to this end by all means; Word and Rod are both intended to this end; he giveth you the Word to make way for Chriſt into the heart; he comes with the Rod, and why with that? <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I ſtand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41272:31"/>with me:</hi> He knocks by the Word, and he knocks by the Rod, and it is all, that the Door may be opened for the exalting of Chriſt. If he do deliver and ſave you in times of trouble, it is that he may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted. Is he not made glorious? If not, you croſs God's deſign, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man, with the lands of love;</hi> and <hi>I was as one that took off the yoke from their jaws, and layed meat before them:</hi> All this was that they might exalt the Lord. Now if it have not this iſſue upon you, you are guilty of the great ſin of thwarting Gods deſigns. Further, there is ſin in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; you pretend that you are for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of Chriſt; this is that you pray for: how oft have you prayed, <hi>Thy Kingdom come?</hi> how oft have you begged that Chriſt might become amiable and lovely to you? and is not Chriſt yet made glorious, not yet exalted? If not, your ſin is this, it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful your Profeſſion is much of it Hypocriſy, and your praying, mocking of God; ſins enow; you need not be guilty of greater evils.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will endanger the intailing of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon you, if Chriſt be not become glorious to you. To ſpeak of two or three things briefly: 1. It will be doubtful it will lay thee under the plague of an hard
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41272:32"/>heart, which is the foreſt of all plagues: if the Lord's dealings do not ſoften thee, and promote Chriſt's Intereſt in thee, it is to be doubted it will ſet thee further from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and will leave thee under very great rocki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtonineſs of heart: Not onely <hi>Pharoah's</hi> heart was hardned, when the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of God in removing the Plague did not work kindly upon him; but <hi>Iſrael</hi> had their hearts hardned alſo, as you may ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the Wilderneſs, when your Fathers tempted me, proved me, and ſaw my works: forty years, &amp;c.</hi> This was the ſin of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old; and poſſibly the like evil may befall thy ſoul. And 2dly, if thy Eſcape have not produced this effect to render Chriſt more glorious, poſſibly thou ſhalt not yet eſcape for all this; thou ſetteſt up thy <hi>Eben-ezer,</hi> and ſayeſt, <hi>Hitherto the Lord hath preſerved;</hi> but it is but <hi>hitherto;</hi> thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth, God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this very Judgement, and cauſe it to cut off thee and many more: the face of things look ſomething ſad for the preſent,<note n="*" place="margin">The Plague increaſing at this time.</note> God is coming back ſome degrees in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and whoſe turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us it may be to fall, we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41272:32"/>know not; it may be any of our conditions, if God find us under hardneſs of heart; do not ſay <hi>the bitterneſs of death is paſt:</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that when the <hi>Caldeans</hi> had beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and by the coming of <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Army the Siege was broken up, preſently the people were confident the <hi>Caldeans</hi> ſhould come no more: but ſee a little what God ſaith, and alſo what he doth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37.7, 8, 9. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, thus ſhall ye ſay unto the King of Judah that ſent you unto me, to enquire of me, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Pharoahs Army which is come forth to help you, ſhall return to Egypt into their own Land, and the Caldeans ſhall come again and fight againſt this City, and take it, and burn it with fire. Thus ſaith the Lord, Deceive not your ſelves, ſaying, The Caldeans ſhall ſurely depart from us; for they ſhall not depart.</hi> And ſo it came to paſſe, for in the <hi>39th</hi> of <hi>Jeremy</hi> firſt verſe, it is ſaid, that <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar King of Babylon came, and all his Army againſt Jeruſalem, and beſieged it;</hi> and in the next verſe it is ſaid, <hi>the City was broken up.</hi> Theſe poor people were confident, becauſe the <hi>Caldeans</hi> were withdrawn and the Siege raiſed, they ſhould be in danger no more. It may be we ſay, the ſtorm is over, the Bill is much decreaſed: but alas it may increaſe again, and be yet more ſore than it hath
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41272:33"/>been. Thus, I ſay, if Chriſt be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in thee, poſſibly thou mayeſt not yet eſcape this Judgment. Or, 3dly, if not by this Judgment, God can meet with thee by others; he hath reſerves of Judgments of divers kinds, and can eaſily and quickly meet with them that are not in the frames they ſhould be; as God ſaith of <hi>Moab, Iſa.</hi> 15.8. <hi>For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-Elim. For the waters of Dimon ſhall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lyons upon him that eſcapeth of Moab, and upon the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Land.</hi> God had been dealing with the Moabites in ſome way of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there was ſome of them remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but though they had been emptyed from veſſel to veſſel, their ſcent ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and now God ſaith he will come forth with another ſtroke. God hath every thing at his command, and he can commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion another Diſpenſation; but let me tell you, it is ſad if after thus long being under the hand of God, Chriſt be not advanced more in your hearts. And this leads me to the third Uſe of the Point.</p>

                  <p>If it be a bleſſed effect of Slaughtering-Judgements upon them that have eſcaped, to have Chriſt become more glorious; what ſhall we think of thoſe, who though they out-live a day of ſad Calamity, yet Chriſt is become more contemptible in their eyes? who inſtead of being brought near unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are at a greater diſtance from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> It is verily a ſad conſideration, that ſuch ſhould be the concluſion of ſuch a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the hearts and ſpirits of any; but yet I fear thus it is with more then a few. <hi>Paul</hi> (2 Tim. 3.13.) tells us, that <hi>evil men and Seducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe:</hi> It is the doom that paſſeth oft times upon evil men, that let the dealings of God with them be what they will, they are the worſe under them; wanting the help of the Spirit of <hi>Grace</hi> to manage and improve them for good, they grow into a worſe and more evil frame by them. All the goodneſs, the gracious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, they are peculiarly directed to win upon the heart, to bring Chriſt and Souls nearer together; this is hinted in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs and forbearance, and long-ſuffering; not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:41272:34"/>We are to interpret the end of Gods kindneſs to be for the bringing the heart to bow, and ſtoop, and fall at the Foot of Jeſus Chriſt; in caſe it have not this iſſue, what iſſue elſe it produces will certainly be very ſad, namely the ſetting Souls at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from Chriſt, and plunging them into a condition worſe then they were in before; and ſo it is added, verſ. 5. <hi>Thou treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath:</hi> thou by this means raiſeſt up greater diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure between him and thy Soul. If you ſay Are there any that really have lower thoughts of Chriſt after they have eſcaped a day of Diſtreſs, then before? I anſwer, it is to be feared too many; and where you find one or more of theſe marks I ſhall lay down, you may conclude that ſuch perſons, though Chriſt hath dealt very tenderly with them, and not ſwept them away in a day of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as he might have done, yet Chriſt is become more contemptible in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts then he was before.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Where you find a ſpirit more ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſtupid, more ſottiſh and ſecure then before; ſuch a one is really ſet at a greater diſtance from Chriſt then before. Some there are, it is much to be feared, that having ſurvived this day of diſtreſs, begin now to look upon themſelves as out of reach, as if
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41272:34"/>no future danger could poſſibly attend them, growing hard hearted, and exceeding ſecure after thoſe dealings of the Lord under which they have fallen; ſuch Souls and Chriſt are farther apart then they were wont to be: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. the Spirit of God tells you, <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwells in the <hi>humble heart,</hi> and with <hi>a broken Spirit:</hi> Now according as you find a heart melted, and broken, and ſaid low, put into a tender frame; ſo far Chriſt makes his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches towards the Soul, and comes to be eſteemed by it; but according as you find the ſpirits of men grow into a hardneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, and ſecurity, by ſo much you may conclude Chriſt is ſet at a diſtance from, and diſ-eſteemed by ſuch Souls: and O that there were not many ſenſible proofs of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſenſible Spirit in many poor Creatures, who yet are allowed a being upon the Earth. If that be allowed to be a ſign of ſecurity which Chriſt himſelf tells us was a ſign of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.38. <hi>For as in the days that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the Ark, and knew not till the flood came and took them all away; ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be:</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, <hi>Noah</hi> was in his days a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, he warned the People of Judgement to come; the People were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41272:35"/>ſtupid, not in the leaſt prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and what was a proof of it? <hi>They were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,</hi> then at a more then ordinary rate; therefore it was an argument, what ever was ſaid unto them, or whatever God intended, they were not much awakened: If that were a ſign of ſtupidity then, ſo it is now ſurely, and gives a great deal of reaſon to conclude that Chriſt hath not gotten, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt upon many of the hearts of thoſe that have eſcaped.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where perſons are more deſperately and eagerly ſet upon their luſts, there you may conclude Chriſt is become more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible then he was. There is ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrariety between ſin and Chriſt, that by how much the more a man grows in love with ſin, by ſo much the more he muſt grow out of love with Chriſt: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the Law of God, neither indeed can be:</hi> Now by how much the more men grow more carnal, by ſo much their enmity againſt Chriſt is increaſed and improved. Sinne doth not onely harden mens hearts, but it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo blinds and ſhuts mens eyes; and by how much the more a man plungeth himſelf in ſin and gives up himſelf to the ſervice of it, by ſo much you may conclude his mind is blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41272:35"/>and his eyes ſhut from ſeeing that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and beauty that is eminently found in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: The more a man ſets himſelf in the way of ſin, the more he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of Satan; and where Satan rules as a Prince, what doth he? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The God of this World</hi> he <hi>blinds the minds of men.</hi> And from this you may gather, if you can obſerve that men that are preſerved this day, their hearts are not in the leaſt taken out of thoſe ways of ſin in which they did walk, but are rather ſet with greater eagerneſs to fulfil the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind; you may, without breach of Charity, conclude thoſe perſons are more blinded, and leſs able to ſee any beauty and excellency in this Branch of the Lord then before. Onely we will hope, if this ſpirit be found upon any, that it is but, as the Apoſtle ſaith ſometimes concerning the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>What then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for; but the Election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded;</hi> We will hope that if there be any that are the more hardened and blinded by this gracious Diſpenſation of Preſervation, it is not the Elect that are blinded, but thoſe that are given up, which the Lord intends not to look after in any gracious way: We will hope for any that have any intereſt in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41272:36"/>the Lord Jeſus, that he hath not, nor will leave them to ſuch a ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you find any more at enmity with the People of Chriſt, then before, you may conclude Chriſt is more contemptible in their eyes then he was before: Mind not what men talk; do not heed mens graſping after the name of Chriſtians, and talking of Chriſt as a Saviour; but know that men may ſpeak of Chriſt, as the whole Nation doth, and other Nations do, and yet have no more real love to him, then thoſe that never heard of Chriſt: It is a very notable Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Thou haſt planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</hi> It may be well with a People, they may be in an outward proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition, they may be flouriſhing, and ſpeak much of Chriſt, and boaſt of him; and yet Chriſt may not have one inch of their Hearts. But you ſhall judge whether really men be for Chriſt or no, by their dealings with his People: if you find their enmity againſt the Saints grow, let their boaſt be as it will, inſtead of diſcovering glory in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are become more at enmity with <hi>Chriſt</hi> then they were. Let me allude, at leaſt, to that word, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1. <hi>Every one that loves him that begat, loveth him that is begotten of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41272:36"/>him:</hi> It is ſpoken concerning the Father and Chriſt; men will ſay they love God, why ſays <hi>John,</hi> You cannot, unleſs you love Chriſt; <hi>for he that loveth him that begetteth, loveth him alſo that is begotten:</hi> So ſay I of Saints; Do you love Chriſt? if ſo, you love them that are begotten of him. To which I might adde a fourth, and that is this:</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Doubtleſs there is cauſe, at leaſt, to fear that the Branch of the Lord is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glorious to thoſe eſcaping ones who have endeavoured to hinder the efficacy and force of this diſpenſation, upon the hearts of poor Creatures: I will tell who I think are ſome way culpable herein; they that have covered the dealings of Chriſt; if there be, as is ſhrewdly ſuſpected, any that have hid this preſent Work of God upon us, and not let us know it in its full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent &amp; latitude<note n="†" place="margin">It was feared ſome <hi>1000's</hi> were kept out of the weekly Bills</note>; it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly lie upon their ſcore that have ſtood in the way of Chriſts Work, and hindered that effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy it might have had upon the hearts of poor Creatures. But to all or any of thoſe that are rather at a greater diſtance from Chriſt, than brought nearer to Chriſt, I ſhall onely ſay in brief, that it is worth the minding. God conſiders what influence and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41272:37"/>effect his dealings have upon the hearts of men; when a Judgement is on their Backs, the Lord conſiders whether it work any good effect upon them, or no; as in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. it is ſaid of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> That <hi>in the time of his diſtreſs, he did treſpaſs againſt the Lord yet more; this is that King Ahaz:</hi> God notes eſpecially that under his hand a perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came worſe and worſe; and there is ſuch a mark put upon him, as is ſcarce put upon any in Scripture, <hi>This is that King Ahaz,</hi> that <hi>Ahaz</hi> that became worſe in a day of diſtreſs. God alſo ſtrictly obſerves how his kindneſs works, in that fore-cited place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering; not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</hi> Obſerve the long-ſuffering of God, and his forbearance, that is, in not cutting down his poor creatures when he hath them at ſome kinde of advantage, as in a day of common Calamity; if God ſpares them then, he manifeſts his riches of Grace and Goodneſs towards them; and if it be not anſwered with ſome ſuitable walking, how doth the Lord interpret ſuch a neglect? He ſays they deſpiſe it. And to end this Uſe, let me take up ſome paſſages in that firſt of the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> it is ſaid, verſ. 24. <hi>I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and you have refuſed; I have ſtretched out
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41272:37"/>my hand, and no man regarded:</hi> The Lord calls by his Word, and he calls by his Rod: He calls by his gentle dealings; his kinde uſage, his preſerving in a day of Calamity, is as much a Call, as the Calamity it ſelf; and he ſaith unto them that anſwer not this Call, and do not improve it aright, verſ. 26. <hi>I will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear cometh.</hi> They that are for a time unaffected, may have a time to be in diſtreſs, when they may ſtand in need of kindneſs to be ſhewed unto them, though they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and kept alive. Verſ. 32. <hi>The turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the prosperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them:</hi> If men turn away from the Calls of God, not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering his expectation, either under Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, or his more ſevere dealings, <hi>their turning away ſhall ſlay them, and their proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall deſtroy them.</hi> Some think, it may be, becauſe they are yet in proſperity, there is no farther hazard: but God ſaith their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity ſhall prove their deſtruction, and bring forth Conſequences, more ſad it may be, then any of which they were afraid in the day when diſtreſs hung over their heads. That is what I would ſay to the third Uſe from this point. A fourth Uſe is this:</p>

                  <p>If the Lord ſhould be beautiful and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto thoſe that eſcape, I would here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf unto a Soul that may be tender and jealous over it ſelf, and fear leſt after its eſcape Chriſt ſhould not be rendered glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious unto it as he ought. Some there are that take no pains to conſider how things are, and whether they go well or ill, that is not the thing that much engages their hearts: others are jealous over their Spirits, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething the treachery of their hearts, they are always apt to doubt and fear. A Soul that knoweth how precious Chriſt ought to be, and beautiful in its eye, fears leſt after ſuch kindneſs received from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it ſhould not ſee that beauty in him, nor be taken with him as it ought: May this be the caſe of any one of us at preſent? I would ſpeak four or five things that may be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and helpful to the Soul in this caſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such is the Glory and Beauty of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that no Soul under Heaven is able to ſee him in all his Glory, nor to admire him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all thoſe bleſſed Perfections where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal Chriſt is cloathed. That expreſſion may be heeded by you, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. where the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of Chriſts glory, calls it,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41272:38"/>
                     <hi>The unſearchable Riches of Chriſt;</hi> it is an Ocean without a bottom, that cannot be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom'd by him that ſearches into it moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately and exactly; it is like the Mines, the bottom of whom is not found out, though men have digged in, and fetched Treaſure from them, for a long time together: Let not a poor Heart think it is at preſent in a capacity of valuing of Chriſt according to all his Worth and Excellency, for that the Soul cannot fully know. What is ſpoken of God, I may allude to, and apply to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Job 11.7. <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching finde out God? canſt thou find out the Almighty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? it is as high as Heaven, what canſt thou do? deeper then Hell, what canſt thou know? the meaſure thereof is longer then the Earth, and broader then the Sea:</hi> Such are the glorious Perfections of this Branch of the Lord, ſhould we meaſure and gueſs at him according to the excellency found in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny created being, alas it would be infinitely ſhort; there is in Chriſt that Excellency that doth exceed and much out-do whatever glory is found upon any thing our eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. Shall I ſay, As <hi>Solomon</hi> in his glory did out-ſhine the glory of all the Princes that were on earth in his time, ſo, and infinitely more, doth the glory of Chriſt out-do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our eyes behold, or whatever our hearts
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41272:39"/>can conceive of? and in our ſearching into his perfections, we may come to do as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did, when ſhe beheld the glory of <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhe gave this teſtimony, What ſhe had heard was true: So may we give this teſtimony of Chriſt, That what we have heard of his Perfections, there is all in him, nay, the one half was not told us: and if the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was amazed, at ſtanding before <hi>Solomons</hi> glory, how much more may we at Chriſts, although we cannot ſee him in all his Perfections. Thou canſt not know him at preſent in this life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all that Glory with which he is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou that art eſcaped art jealous that Chriſt is not become beautiful enough unto thee; Remember that the higheſt pitch unto which the Soul can come in this life, is, to deſire to ſee more of that beauty that is in him: The higheſt pitch in any thing that is good in this life, is to deſire to be better: The Deſires of the Soul do out-go in this life any Acts that it is able to put forth. <hi>David,</hi> in the caſe of Holineſs, the higheſt pitch of his Holineſs is expreſſed in his deſire, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.5. <hi>O that my Ways were directed to keep thy Statutes!</hi> he did keep them in ſome meaſure, but the higheſt pitch unto which he got, was to deſire to keep them better: ſo
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41272:39"/>alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.11. <hi>Teach me thy ways, O Lord, I will walk in thy truth; unite my heart to fear thy Name:</hi> he was ſenſible that his heart did in ſome things wander from God, he did not fear him as he ſhould, but the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his attainment lay in his deſires. <hi>Paul</hi> was a man very excellent in his day, and doubtleſs did know and enjoy much of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet the higheſt pitch he attained, was large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, and workings of deſire, expreſt in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. <hi>This one thing I do, forgetting the things that are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things that are before, I preſs towards the mark, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> the deſires of his heart were large. And ſo the Spouſe hath an high eſteem of Chriſt, ſhe expreſſes the value ſhe hath of him at a great rate, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>As the Apple-Tree among the Trees of the Wood, ſo is my Beloved among the Sons; I ſat down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſhaddow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet unto my taſte; ſtay me with Flaggons, comfort me with Apples, for I am ſick of love:</hi> her heart was much taken with Chriſt, ſeeing a great deal of Beauty in him; but you ſhall ſee her deſires did out-do any act ſhe could put forth; and therefore (<hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16.) ſhe ſays, <hi>Awake, O North Wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden, that the Spices thereof may flow out:</hi> ſhe would have her
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41272:40"/>heart enlarged, her Graces acted more ſtrongly. Now Soul, take in this for thy comfort, it is a good frame that thou deſireſt to prize Chriſt more, and have this Branch of the Lord more glorious in thy account, though thou canſt not put forth ſuch acts as thou wouldeſt: Remember thou art in that frame that the beſt of Saints have been in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider this, thou that art eſcaped, and feareſt that the Branch of the Lord is not become ſo glorious as it ſhould be; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that jealouſie over thy heart, is a good ſign, and gives ſome hope that Chriſt hath gotten ſome ground upon thee: The wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.15. ſaith, <hi>The ſimple believeth every word, but the prudent man looks well to his going:</hi> Some are ſo ſimple to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every good word their hearts ſpeak; if they find any thing that looks like good, they are apt to conclude that all is right: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wiſe man (<hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14.) ſaith, <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is the man that feareth always:</hi> I apply it unto this; It is a good thing ſometimes to bear a jealouſie, a conſtant jealouſie over the heart, leſt it ſhould not be wrought up to that pitch it ought. The Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> gives us a warrant for holy jealouſies and fears, leſt we ſhould fall ſhort: They that have been moſt confident of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the frame of their ſpirits, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41272:40"/>been in none of the beſt: <hi>Jehu</hi> cries, <hi>Come ſee my Zeal for the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> when he had not one grain of true Zeal for the Lord of Hoſts in him.</p>

Thou that wouldeſt have this Branch of the Lord glorious, if thy heart work real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this way; Know this, thou art accepted in this thy deſire: It will paſs for a good improvement of this mercy of thy Eſcape. I confeſs ſome things there are, which I find the Lord is angry at; He loves not to ſee ſouls ſit down ſatisfied and pleaſed in ways of ſin, therefore he doth reflect upon them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1. that <hi>ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornful;</hi> he is much angry with them that can conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly take up in ways of ſin, and therefore you find him falling foul upon them that harden their hearts in ways of ſin, and alſo with thoſe that content themſelves with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meaſures of Grace, when they have means to riſe up unto greater: He rebukes the Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.26. for the littleneſs of their Faith, <hi>O ye of little Faith;</hi> he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids them with the littleneſs of their Faith, becauſe he had long been with them himſelf, as he doth hint unto them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; <hi>Have I been ſo long with thee, and yet thou haſt not known me?</hi> But this obſerve alſo, That where there is but a leſſer mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Grace, if the heart be really work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41272:41"/>after more, it is accepted, and Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it with good will: The beſt inſtance I know in the whole Bible, is that in <hi>Mark</hi> 9.23, 24. where the Father of a Child poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a dumb Spirit comes unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> for cure; Chriſt tells him, <hi>All things are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unto him that believeth,</hi> and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he cried out, and ſaid with tears, <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief:</hi> he had a little Faith, and deſired more; therefore you find Chriſt doth not reject his little, but hears him, and calls unto the dumb Devil to come forth of his Child: So if thou complaineſt that Chriſt is not exalted in thy heart to any great degree, but thou longeſt he ſhould be more; believe it, it ſhall be accepted: as it is ſaid in another caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted, according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not:</hi> Thus if really thou wouldeſt have Chriſt become more glorious unto thee, thou mayſt be accepted in this which thou haſt, and it ſhall not be charged upon thee that thou art wanting in that which thou yet hadſt not. Under the Law, when a Thank-Offering was to be returned, and the Soul to admire the Lord in ſome kindneſs received, he that could bring but two Turtle Doves, and two young Pigeons, if that were the moſt they had, and the beſt they could bring,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41272:41"/>it was accepted as well as thoſe that brought the greateſt Offerings; their hearts were enlarged, it is like, to bring more: So though thou haſt but little, if thou deſireſt more, thy little will be accepted, though but two Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Doves, or two young Pigeons.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thou that wouldeſt prize Chriſt more, know this, That the Lord will increaſe that Grace in thee; and thou ſhalt be able to prize him at a greater rate: <hi>The Lord direct your hearts into the Love of God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.5. it is the Lord that muſt direct thee into the Love of Chriſt, and he will do it, if thy heart be really working that way; if thou doſt prize him as much as thou canſt, he will help thee to prize him more. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy ſubſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all thine increaſe; ſo ſhall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy preſſes ſhall burſt with new Wine:</hi> If thou doſt with the firſt and beſt of thy ſtrength, endeavour to honour the Lord, he will encreaſe thy ſtrength, and communicate unto thee abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.

Truly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>I might ſpeak a word to another ſort of perſons: If eſcaping a Day of Calamity ſhould cauſe a Soul to ſee a greater Beauty in Chriſt, what ſhould it work upon them on whom the Calamity is fallen, and yet are eſcaped? There are many ſuch, if you that read what I have written, meet with them, and know them, you may do well to give them a little account of what may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſuch a caſe: How ſhould that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be admired, when poor Creatures have had Bodies full of pain, Spirits full of fear, looking the King of Terrours in the face e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41272:43"/>moment; poor Creatures that it may be would have given, had they had it, all the world, to have been aſſured they ſhould have been raiſed from their Bed, and ſet upon their Feet; poor Creatures that it is like were ſequeſter'd from company, whoſe caſe was like that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 38.11. <hi>My Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and my Friends ſtand aloof from my ſore, and my Kinſmen ſtand afar off:</hi> Now that the Lord ſhould be with and look after them, in ſuch a time, and raiſe them, this ſhould have ſuch effects as ſuch a mercy had once upon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38.15. <hi>I ſhall go ſoftly all my years, in the bitterneſs of my Soul;</hi> that is, I ſhall retain a ſence of the bitterneſs that was upon my Soul, and in that ſence I ſhall go ſoftly; the man that walks ſoftly, ſtep by ſtep, he goes heedfully and carefully, and mindes every ſtep he takes; ſo ſhould ſuch poor Souls walk, that have been delivered from ſuch hazard and bitterneſs of Soul; they ſhould walk warily the reſt of their time: To which, two things may much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That certainly the Eſcape, in ſuch a caſe, is thorow Chriſt: I am ſatisfied in this, That this Judgement of the Plague, as other Diſeaſes, hath in it natural Cauſes, and natural Means are helpful to deliver from it; but as it is in other caſes, whatever
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41272:43"/>natural Cauſes there are to further any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe upon the Body of Man, the Lord hath a hand in it, and makes uſe of thoſe natural Cauſes; and ſo whatever Means are uſeful for recovery in any caſe, the bleſſing and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of it depends upon the Lord; ſo it is in this caſe alſo very eminently, that a Soul may ſay as it is ſaid <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.16. <hi>O Lord, by theſe things men live, and in all theſe things is the life of my Spirit;</hi> ſome read the words, <hi>They ſhall live for whom the Lord is,</hi> which is a great variation from our Tranſlation: <hi>They ſhall live for whom the Lord is;</hi> that is, whoſe protection he is, and whom he ſtands by.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Chriſt be not glorious to ſuch a Soul, he can bring a worſe evil upon them; <hi>John</hi> 5.14. <hi>Go away, ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee:</hi> God can bring a worſe thing upon a Creature then the Plague, he can make death to be choſen rather then life; as you have it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.3. <hi>And death ſhall be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen rather then life, by all the reſidue of them that remain of this evil family,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>A Uſe to thoſe that Chriſt hath carried from place to place, and ſo have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: Think not thy ſelf the leſs indebted unto Chriſt, for his kindneſs towards thee; He is to be as glorious unto ſuch, as to any: let it not leſſen the mercy, that thou haſt not ſeen the diſmal ſight, and heard the doleful cries of them into whoſe Windows Death hath entred. I know we are apt not to be affected, or at leaſt very little, with things that our eyes do not ſee, and our ears hear; but that is an evil frame: and certainly though our abode may not have been in the time of this Diſtreſs, in the heat of it, in the midſt of it; yet we owe our preſervation unto Chriſt, as much as any, and ought to ſee that it have influence upon us as much as any; and that,</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:41272:45"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſidering it doth not leſſen but heighten the mercy, that thou art not onely preſerved from falling, but from partaking in that bitterneſs and trouble of ſpirit that hath certainly born down many who have lived in the heat of this Diſtreſs. Days of Slaughter and Calamity, are days of heart-trouble to them that are preſerved in the midſt of them; <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.5, 6. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord, We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace; ask ye now, and ſee whether a man doth travel with Child; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now do I ſee every man with his hands on his loyns, as a woman in travel, and all faces are turned into paleneſs?</hi> It is ſpoken with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome that lived in times and places when and where ſlaughtering-Judgements were abroad; and they that were alive, what was the horror &amp; perplexity of their ſpirits! Do not think, Soul, but thou art the more engaged to Chriſt, that he hath graciouſly carried thee out of the ſight and noiſe of thoſe direful out-cries: Many can ſay, We could hardly paſs the Streets but meet with Coffins, and hear the cries and complaints of Friends bereft of their Relations; bleſs the Lord, that he kept thee from the hearing of this: Not but that Chriſt can make the hearing and ſeeing ſuch things, turn greatly to advantage; but yet it is a piece of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41272:46"/>if Chriſt will do the Soul good at ſome cheaper rate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider thou couldſt not have found ſhelter any where, had not Chriſt led thee thither: as it is not good to go without Chriſts leading us, nor could we have gone any where, if the Lord had not made our way for us: <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.9. <hi>A mans heart deviſeth his way, but the Lord directeth his ſteps:</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were conſidering whither to go, and what to do, and laid their deſigns, but if the Lord did not order their ſteps, they could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. You have a notable word, <hi>Job</hi> 3.23. <hi>Why is light given to a man whoſe way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? Job</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with ſad diſtreſſes, and he would fain have gotten out of them, but ſaith he, <hi>My way is hid,</hi> (he knew not whither to fly) <hi>I am hedged in,</hi> I muſt ſtay by it. This hath been the caſe of many, their ways have been hedged in; and he could have hedged in thee and me, if ſo it had pleaſed him: and therefore if you and I have been carried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to places where we have been preſerved, let us admire the goodneſs of the Lord: <hi>Jonah roſe up to flee to Tarſhiſh from the preſence of the Lord;</hi> but he could not, the Lord hindred him.

                  <p>A tenth Uſe may be to Sinners that are eſcaped; You are preſerved, it's true, and Chriſt, this Branch of the Lord, ſhould be glorious unto you: If thou art yet in a ſtate of ſin, I would ſay unto thee four or five things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though thou art eſcap'd, Chriſt is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glorious unto thee: a Soul in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition ſeeth no Glory and Beauty in Chriſt; it is the work of Faith that opens the Eyes to ſee Chriſts Glory and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To you that believe he is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> Though it be thy Duty, thou canſt not live up to it; thy Eyes are blind, faſt cloſed, and the Glory of Chriſt is not diſcerned by thee: this therefore is thy miſery, thou haſt not anſwered the Lords expectation in this eminent preſervation. Sinners cry as they, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2. <hi>We ſee no form nor comlineſs in him, nor Beauty, for which we ſhould deſire him:</hi> the Sinners Eyes are faſt cloſed, that though this be thy Duty, thou canſt not ſee it. Nor</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:41272:47"/>
                  <p n="2">2ly. Canſt thou interpret thy Preſervation to be out of good will to thee: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things ſhall work together for good unto them that love God;</hi> but thou doſt not love the <hi>Lord,</hi> nor art thou the <hi>Called of the Lord,</hi> thou art ſtill in thy ſin, and for the preſent canſt not interpret this diſpenſation to be in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: what may be in the heart of God, what ſecret purpoſe he may have, how he may deſign hereafter to bring thee near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, thou canſt not tell, it is hidden for the preſent; and yet thou canſt not ſee there is any good intended thee in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: and this is ſad, it exceedingly robs the Soul of the ſweetneſs of ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, when it cannot be took to be in kindneſs. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. If thou art a Sinner, thou wilt uſe thy preſervation to a wrong end: Sinners, if they ask mercy, it is uſually to wrong ends; and if they receive mercies, they improve them ſinfully; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.18. <hi>They tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their luſt;</hi> they asked a mercy, but it was for their luſt, and they did as ſadly improve it, verſ. 28, 29, 30. <hi>And he let it fall in the midſt of their Camp, ſo they did eat, and were well filled, for he gave them their own deſire; they were not eſtranged from their luſt, but while their meat was yet in their mouths, the wrath of God came
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41272:47"/>upon them, &amp;c.</hi> Thus it will be with thee, Soul, if thou art yet in thy Sin; it is true, thou art preſerved, but it will be to a farther miſery; thou haſt asked it to ſinful ends, and wilt uſe it ſinfully, and ſo bring a curſe upon thy ſelf. This is the miſery of a poor Soul in ſin, he ſpoils his Mercies, and brings down the wrath of God upon himſelf. To which add,</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. If thou remaineſt in ſin, the time is coming when thou wilt certainly give a ſad accompt of this mercy thou haſt received, and wilt really fall under a diſpenſarion much more ſad then that from which thou art now delivered: <hi>Chriſt will come in flaming fire, and render vengeance unto them that know not God, nor obey the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> the great intent of which, is the exalting of Chriſt. Now when by all means thou haſt not been provoked to anſwer this end; what will the reſult and iſſue of all be, but the rendring vengeance unto thee, and the wrapping thee up in eternal miſery? I would therefore ſay unto a Soul in ſin, What wilt thou do? thou art a dying creature; though thou haſt eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped this ſtorm, and art in ſafety to day, Eternity will ſoon come upon thee: Ah what wilt thou do? Soul, thy great work ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in two things, I will but even name them: Firſt, Go unto the Lord, that he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41272:48"/>would open thy eyes to ſee thy own miſery, and Chriſt in his glory, that he would anoint thine Eyes with his Eye-ſalve, that may cauſe the ſcales of ignorance to fall from them, ſo as that thou mayſt ſee thy ſelf and Chriſt, aright: Secondly, Beg that thou mayſt have a heart to give up thy ſelf to Chriſt, that the glory thou ſeeſt in him, may make thee reſtleſs until thou haſt taken hold of him, without which thou canſt not walk comfortably, though thou art preſerved, nor canſt thou cheerfully look another time of trouble in the face, and much leſs that time when thou ſhalt be going to thy long home.</p>

Conſider how many, of Spirits more excellent, of Hearts more enlarged, of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe in their places, that have been more ſerviceable unto Chriſt and his Intereſt, then thou haſt been, have yet fallen, and thou preſerved: Should not this mercy wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affect thine heart? Yea,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take this, that the more thou ſeeſt of the Glory of Chriſt, and the more he gains in eſteem upon the Soul, the more the Soul doth gain; it is gain, yea great gain, great riches for the Soul to improve in its eſteem of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Is not Chriſt the great thing the Goſpel preſents, that every Soul ſhould be ſeeking after? Now the more thou haſt of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41272:49"/>him in thy heart, the more thou haſt of true Treaſure, of Riches that are truly ſo called. To which add,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That if Chriſt do not become glorious unto us, the time is haſtening when he will be glorious in the eſteem of others: He will have glory, no thanks unto us. Certainly it is not long, but Chriſt will make himſelf glorious, and get himſelf a Name and Praiſe; and all theſe ſlaughtering Providences they do but tend to that end. Chriſt is at work, though in the dark as to us, and we cannot ſee his out-goings; yet he is really working out his own advancement, and will make all theſe end in his own glory: Which leads me unto the ſecond <hi>Doctrine</hi> from the <hi>Words.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Iſſue of all Slaughtering-Judgements ſhall be the making Chriſt glorious; and that glory that ſhall be put upon the Head of Chriſt, ſhall tend to the Good and Benefit of thoſe of Iſrael that ſhall eſcape the Slaughter.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis Truth lieth as plainly in the Words as may be; and for the proſecution of it, I ſhall propound this plain method:</p>
               <p>Firſt, To ſhew you that in days of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God may not eſcape: Some of them may, but others may fall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the reſult of the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoever ſtands or falls, ſhall be for the raiſing up Chriſt and his glory, for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him a Name.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you what glory ſhall be brought to Chriſt in the end and iſſue of the ſlaughters that ſhall be made in the World. And</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That all the glory that ſhall be put upon the head of Chriſt, ſhall be in mercy
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41272:50"/>unto thoſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that out-live and eſcape the Diſtreſſes that ſhall break in upon the World. And then</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Application will follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To begin then with the firſt, <hi>viz. That in days of ſlaughter all the Iſrael of God poſſibly may not eſcape; ſome of them may fall to the ground:</hi> That is clearly intimated in the Text, <hi>The Branch of the Lord ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to THEM that ARE eſcaped of Iſrael;</hi> ſtrongly holding out to us, that ſome among <hi>Iſrael</hi> may fall. I need ſay nothing to confirm this Truth, but onely refer you to our ſad experience this day: I might bid you go round unto all the Churches of Chriſt in and about the great City, and ask them how it hath fared with the Saints of God this day; doubtleſs you will find every of them rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning up their Slain, and thoſe that have fallen by the Sword of the Angel: I might bid you go unto every Soul that knows God in truth, in and about this City, and ſee what account they will give you; I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you would find almoſt every of them making ſome or other ſad complaint for the loſs of ſuch and ſuch a Chriſtian Friend, and ſuch a one that feared the Lord, with whom they had much intimacy and acquaintance: this is the general cry among the Saints this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41272:50"/>day. But a little, that theſe proceedings of God may not ſtartle you; you ſhall finde ſome footſteps of like dealings in the days of old, that God hath not walked in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodden path, but a courſe he hath ſometimes taken in days and times paſt. Sometimes in Scripture you find the Lord threatning of, and cutting down onely the Uncircumciſed Ones, the profane Nations and People of the earth; thus <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32. you have a long Catalogue of the dreadful Judgements of God upon men uncircumciſed, from ver. 20. to verſ. 30. where he tells you that many of the barbarous Nations that knew not God, <hi>are gone down to the pit, being ſlain with the ſword;</hi> and he concludes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. <hi>There be the Princes of the North, all of them, and the Zidonians, which are gone down with the ſlain, with their terrour; they are aſhamed of their might, and they lie uncircumciſed with them that be ſlain by the ſword, and bear their ſhame with them that go down to the pit,</hi> &amp;c. At other times you find the Lord dealing with his own People, as with the uncircumciſed, and laying them together under the ſame Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Diſtreſs; <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. is a famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>Behold, the days come ſaith the Lord, that I will puniſh all them which are circumciſed, with the uncircumciſed:</hi> God tells us plainly there are ſuch times in which
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41272:51"/>his own People and others may fare alike; Calamities and Diſtreſſes may make no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; it may be in ſome meaſure unto the Saints as it is to the Sinners. You ſhall find the Lord in Scripture ſometimes threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens as heavy things againſt his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. the Prophet begins to beg mercy for <hi>Iſrael, O the Hope of Iſrael,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble! why ſhouldſt thou be as a Stranger in the Land, and as a way-faring man that turneth aſide to tarry for a night?</hi> in which words he ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that it would be a ſtrange thing, a ſtrange way of proceeding, if God ſhould turn againſt his People; if thou art the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of thy People, wilt thou yet turn thy hand againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom thou haſt been known as a Saviour? but God ſtopt the mouth of the Prophet, verſ. 11, 12. <hi>Then ſaid the Lord unto me, Pray not for this People for their good; when they faſt, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-Offerings, and an Oblation, I will not accept them; but I will conſume them by the Sword, by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence:</hi> This very <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto whom God was ſometimes known as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, yet at this time he took up a reſolution concerning them, that he would come out againſt them and conſume them by his ſore Judgements. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. God threatens
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41272:51"/>ſome that out-lived and eſcaped ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, verſ. 27. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, As I live, ſurely they that are in the Waſtes ſhall fall by the Sword, and him that is in the open Field will I give unto the Beaſts to be devoured, and they that be in the Forts and in the Caves ſhall die of the Peſtilence;</hi> This is ſpoken of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And thoſe of Iſrael that as yet were not carried away captive, God comes out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them with this purpoſe and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that though they did remain and were preſerved, they ſhould at length fall. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.13. ſome there were that in the time of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Captivity, fled into <hi>Egypt</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and what ſays he? <hi>I will puniſh them that dwell in the Land of Egypt, as I have puniſhed Jeruſalem, by the Sword, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and by the Peſtilence:</hi> obſerve, God ſometimes puniſheth <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Seat of his own People, with theſe great and ſore Judgements: Sometimes if his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall think to take Sanctuary, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge themſelves here and there, it ſhall not avail, but the hand of the Lord ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them. Let me tell you, not onely ſome of Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> may fall by ſlaughter, but ſome of the principal of his People, ſome of the choice ones of the flock; <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.34, 35. <hi>Howl ye Shepherds, and cry, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your ſelves in the Aſhes, ye principal of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41272:52"/>Flock; for the dayes of your Slaughter, and of your Diſperſion are accompliſhed, and ye ſhall fall like a pleaſant veſſel, and the Shepherds ſhall have no way to flee, nor the Principal of the Flock to eſcape.</hi> We are apt to ſay, when we ſee God terrible in his doings to the children of men, and terrible in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to his own People, What do theſe things mean? We are ready to look upon ſuch Providences as things uncouth, ſtrange and unheard-of; but we finde it is not out of the courſe and method that God hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved heretofore. So that I may conclude in reſpect of common calamity, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falls according to that, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.2. <hi>All things come alike unto all: there is one event to the Righteous, and to the Wicked; to the Good, to the Clean, and to the Unclean; to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not. As is the Good, ſo is the Sinner; and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the Reaſon be demanded, <hi>How comes it to paſs, and whence is it, that any of God's Iſrael ſhould fall in times of ſlaughter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Not to inſiſt upon the Prerogative of God, (which might be the firſt thing) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is Lord of all his Creatures, and his own People as well as others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may diſpenſe unto all according to the good-pleaſure of his own Will.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:41272:52"/>
               <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place; the ground of it may be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That God cannot keep his Covenant with his People ſometimes at any cheaper rate, he cannot be faithfull ſometimes to his Promiſe with his own People, unleſs he let them feel ſome ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rod, and taſte of that Cup of which he makes his Enemies drink a full Draught; God by Covenant ſtands bound to purge out the folly that is bound up in the hearts of his Children; and truly ſometimes luſts in the Soul are like ruſt in Iron, deeply eat in, and cannot well be gotten out without ſome ſevere and ruff uſage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But thirdly, The main Reaſon, the grand and principal Ground why ſome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> may periſh in times of common Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is this; they ſin as the world, and ſo God leaves them to ſuffer with, and as the world; their provocations are like the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keds, therefore he is pleaſed to ſuit out an external puniſhment, ſomething like that that falls upon the reſt of the world: the Lord ſaith, that ſometimes the ſin of his own People, is not onely as the ſin of the world but greater; <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.28. <hi>They are waxen fat, they ſhine, yea they overpaſs the deeds of the wicked.</hi> It is ſpoken of God's <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The truth is, though the ſin of Saints ſhall never damn them, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41272:53"/>in Chriſt, and <hi>there is no condem nation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. (and herein is much of the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace of the new Covenant, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſin of Saints may have ſome ſuch provoking ingredients as the ſin of ſinners hath not, that yet ſinners ſhall periſh eternally under their ſins, but the Saints ſhall not come into condemnation) yet I ſay the ſin of a Saint may lay him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an external diſpenſation with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: the Saints ſin againſt ſuch light as few ſinners do, and ſuch love as no ſinner can, and that makes their provocation more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking than the ſins of ſinners: When it is thus among the Lord's People, the Lord is pleaſed to let them; or ſome of them at leaſt, to fall by ſore ſlaughter. It is upon ſuch a ſuppoſition that God threatens his People in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58. <hi>If thou wilt not obſerve to do all the words of this Law that are written in this day, that thou mayeſt fear this glorious and fearful Name, THE LORD THY GOD: Then the Lord will make thy Plagues wonderful, and the Plagues of thy ſeed, even great Plagues, and of long continuance, and ſore ſickneſs, and of long continuance.</hi> The caſe ſuppoſed here is this, That God's People may not keep to the Law of the Lord, that they may not carry it like a people that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41272:53"/>know ſomething of God, that they may not carry it as a people that know what dread there is in the Name JEHOVAH, (which is a Name that ſpeaks the Great God able to meet with, &amp; avenge himſelf on all them that walk not with him in Truth and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs) that they may not carry it as thoſe that have intreſt in the Lord: Intreſt in the Lord doth not give a liberty unto ſin, but is the greateſt engagement unto Holineſs, and ſouls may forget that Obligation under which they lie, thoſe bonds of God that are upon them, that filial Child-like obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which they are to render unto their Father, and upon ſuch defects God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, as you have heard; Take his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a few particulars, and you ſhall ſee what ſin may bring upon the Lord's own People: he threatneth, firſt, Plagues, yea, all kind of Plagues, Judgements of every ſort. 2dly, Such as ſhould be wonderfull, that ſhould be full of terrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto all that look upon them; as God ſometimes ſpeaks to his People, and tells them he will <hi>make them an aſtoniſhment to all round about them,</hi> yea ſuch as ſhould make them a wonder unto themſelves. 3dly, He threatens they ſhould lie under Plagues of long continuance, year after year: we are apt to think a judgment muſt be terminated
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41272:54"/>to, and ended in ſuch a ſpace of time; but God can ſtretch it out upon his own, even for a long ſeaſon. 4thly, All the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhall come upon them, all the Judgements they were afraid of, and proved a terrour unto their ſouls. 5thly, They might fall under ſuch Judgements as they had not heard, or at any time read of before; he would create trouble to them: Certainly if it be according to that word, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33. that <hi>the Lord doth not afflict wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, nor grieve the children of men:</hi> though they are but the children of men, the Lord doth not eaſily afflict them, not at every turn contend with them, much leſs will he upon light and ſlight occaſions contend with his own People, and the choiceſt of his own; but when he finds them under provocations he is pleaſed thus to break out againſt them. Obſerve that where you find God coming out to cut off his People by a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſtroke, you ſhall find ſome notable provocation was the procuring cauſe, it was not for nothing; <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.21. <hi>The Lord ſhall make the Peſtilence cleave unto thee, until he hath conſumed thee from off the Land whither thou goeſt to poſſeſs it.</hi> It was ſpoken to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> upon what occaſion? the 15th verſe will tell you; <hi>But it ſhall come to paſs, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41272:54"/>Lord thy God, to obſerve to do all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Statutes, which I command thee this day, that all theſe Curſes ſhall come upon thee, and overtake thee.</hi> And ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Wherefore as I live, ſaith the Lord God, ſurely becauſe thou haſt defiled my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary with all thy deteſtable things, and with all thine abominations; therefore will I alſo diminiſh thee, neither ſhall mine eye ſpare, nor will I have any pity. A third part of thee ſhall die by the Peſtilence, and with Famine ſhall they be conſumed in the midſt of thee, and a third part ſhall fall by the Sword round about thee; and I will ſcatter a third part into all the winds, and will draw out a Sword after them, &amp;c.</hi> Here are dreadful threatnings, and it was upon great provocations; there were great turnings aſide from God, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting his Worſhip, polluting his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the fire of God's jealouſy burns hot about his Sanctuary; and if he find his People in the matter of his Worſhip corrupted, he breaks out againſt them with great ſeverity: It was upon ſome ſuch account <hi>David</hi> ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the place, the high place at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> where the Plague was; he knew that he had deſerved death, and therefore he could not go to <hi>Gibeon,</hi> for he was afraid becauſe of the Sword of the Angel of the Lord, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.28. I may allude to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41272:55"/>that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. I know the words have another ſenſe than that that is before me, but I allude to them only; and as he ſaith, <hi>When the Righteous turneth away from his Righteouſneſs, and committeth Iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth, ſhall he live? all his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: in his treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his ſin that he hath ſinned ſhall he die.</hi> So I may ſay, when the Saints of God turn into wayes of ſinners, and act in like provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with them, in the ſins they ſin, and the treſpaſſes that they commit, they may die, and the hand of the Lord may break out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them to the ſlaughtering of them, and cutting them down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. If any ſhall object here and ſay, <hi>If the Saints may be ſlaughtered by, and fall in common Calamity, what profit hath the Jew then, and what advantage is there by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion? what advantage hath the Saint above and beyond the Sinner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer; He hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage many wayes; to name a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though one of God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> may fall by a ſlaughtering Judgment, yet he is in the leaſt danger of any one; he may fall as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do, but he is in the leaſt danger;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41272:55"/>there is greater hope of his ſecurity than of thoſe that know not God: The Saints have the Spirit of God to lead them into his way and work, and therefore are not ſo eaſily left to run into thoſe ſins that may provoke God to cut them off by ſuch Judgments; all the Sons of God are led by the Spirit of God; Rom. 8.14. <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God are the Sons of God; &amp; è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra:</hi> a bleſſed Promiſe the Lord doth make in that <hi>25th Pſalm</hi> unto his own People touching the guidance they ſhall have; <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord, him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chuſe.</hi> God here engageth himſelf not to leave his People to themſelves, to the ways and workings of their own hearts, but to direct them into his way; and when he hath them in his way, what then? <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>his ſoul ſhall dwell at eaſe,</hi> or, as <hi>Junius</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates, <hi>his ſoul ſhall dwell in good;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, when I guide my People into my ways, than evil ſhall not eaſily overtake them; but they ſhall dwel and reſt in good, and mercy ſhall compaſs them about; if they ſtep out of Gods way, the Lord knows how to call them back again; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This is the way, walk ye in it.</hi> If the Saints have provoked God, there is a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41272:56"/>for them to make their peace, that the difference may not grow to any great height; they may compound the difference, and make up the breach, by a ſpirit of mourning and humiliation; they may lye at the foot of the Lord, and abhor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in duſt and aſhes, and ſo make up the breach: and to this work they are fitted in ſome meaſure through Grace; nay, they have a Friend in Heaven that intercedeth for them; and though they have provoked God, the difference may be by him ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated, that God may be ſtopped from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth in his hot Diſpleaſure. I make no doubt but the Lord may ſay concerning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his People, as he doth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.23. <hi>Therefore he ſaid he would deſtroy them, had not Moſes his choſen ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the breach.</hi> Doubtleſs our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> he of whom <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was a type, and in this a great type, doth oftentimes ſtep in between the Lord and his People, and make up the Breach, and divert that Wrath that otherwiſe would come down in dreadful Judgments, to the cutting them off the Earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though a Saint may fall into a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, yet it is advantagious to be a Saint in ſuch a day, for ſuch a one, though he fall, he ſhall be ſupported in his fall, and the curſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41272:56"/>of the Judgment ſhall be taken off. God may chaſten his People with a Rod, let looſe the ſevereſt Judgments upon them. He may cut them down, but yet he muſt hold them by the hand; by Covenant he ſtands bound to give them ſtrength for every tryal; and bleſſed Experiences there have been of this kind this day, of thoſe Servants of God that have gone to their eternity by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; There are them that have left this Teſtimony, <hi>That God was with them in that hour;</hi> and though the Judgement in it ſelf conſidered, had much of bitterneſs in it, yet God was pleaſed to ſweeten it to them by an abundant ſence of Divine Love: it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.5. <hi>Let the Saints be joyful in glory, let them ſing aloud upon their bed.</hi> Some Saints are not only joyfull in Glory now they are with God, but have ſung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud upon their ſick and death-beds, on which they have been caſt by this preſent Judgment of God, and declared to the praiſe of his Grace, that he did ſupport and chear their inward man by the enjoyment of his bleſſed refreſhing Preſence in that needful hour; and truly the curſe and ſting of ſuch a Diſpenſation is taken away from the Saints.

Wilt thou alſo deſtroy the Righteous with the Wicked? peradventure there be fifty Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous within the City, wilt thou alſo deſtroy and not ſpare the place for the fifty Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that are therein? that be far from thee to do after this manner, to ſlay the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with the Wicked; and that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhould be as the Wicked, that be far from thee; ſhould not the Judge of all the Earth do right? <hi>and alſo that</hi> Exod. 12.29, 30. <hi>where God cuts off the firſt-born of</hi> Egypt; from the firſt-born of Pharaoh that ſat on his Throne, unto the firſt-born of the Captive that was in the Dungeon; <hi>but not a hair of the head fell from any in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and he cuts them off by the Plague.</hi>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41272:59"/>Ones, he may mean thoſe that were free in agreat meaſure from the crying Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for which God was coming to puniſh: Now if the People of God do ſtand clear from all thoſe Abominations for which he contends with a People, then truly God will hardly cut them off; but if he find them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ſins for which he puniſheth, he may then ſuffer them to fall among them that fall: This was the caſe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> God comes forth to execute Judgements upon the Oppreſſors of his People, the guilt was not in them, they were onely the Sufferers; therefore being free from the Sin, God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts them from any part in the ſuffering: Which may be enough for anſwer to that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. If it be ſaid, <hi>But Iſraels Fall hath. diſappointed the Faith of many of the Lords People; have not many of the Saints verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the Lords People ſhould not have been touched, but God would diſtinguiſh between them and others?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, That the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and expectation of ſome may be made void, but God will not fail the Faith of any; God fails no mans Faith, if his Faith do not fail. There is a vaſt difference between Confidence, Expectation, and Faith; Faith is a rare thing, a choice Plant, and I believe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41272:60"/>it doth not ſpring forth into act, even in the Garden of the Saints themſelves, as we are apt to imagine; we many times think a groundleſs Confidence real Faith. You ſhall find the expectation of a People may be fruſtrated; <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.15. <hi>We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, but behold trouble:</hi> they did look for it, but ſuch an expectation muſt not be called by the name of Faith: Let me tell you, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is Faith but that that is grounded upon a Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Remember thy Word unto thy Servant, on the which thou haſt cauſed me to hope.</hi> It is very hard to find any word in Scripture, where God doth abſolutely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto his People exemption in a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering-Calamity, eſpecially until Chriſt ſhall come forth to execute Judgement upon the Earth. Therefore there not being a word for ſuch Faith, there cannot be a Faith of ſuch a diſtinction: Though men may call their vain expectations by the name of Faith, they ſhall never find it to have Faiths Efficacy.</p>

If it be further ſaid, <hi>That by the falling of Gods Iſrael, the Lord croſſes and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his own deſign; he hinders the effect of the Judgement upon the Hearts of ſinners; their hearts come by this means to be the more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and they thence conclude it is not intended

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer: What if God will, for the hardning the hearts of Sinners, let ſome of his own fall? What if that ſhall be one part of Gods deſign in it, that their hearts may be hardened, and thereby they may be the more ripened for their utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſtruction?

If, in the ſixth place, you ſhould ask me, <hi>But what ſhall we ſay concerning thoſe of Gods Iſrael that are fallen? muſt we conclude them all fallen in their treſpaſſes, and cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome notable provocation that they ſtood guilty of?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, No, in no wiſe; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that hath been ſaid: But my poor thoughts are theſe, That ſome of the Lords own Iſrael may have had too great a hand in, and may have ſtood under too much guilt with reſpect to ſome of the provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this day, and ſo may be fallen in their treſpaſſes; God may have cut them off from the Earth in ſome diſpleaſure, for ſome Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, in which they have been found,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41272:61"/>though he may receive them to himſelf in glory: but I muſt ſay concerning others of the Lord's People this day fallen, and ſome of them have this witneſs in my ſoul, that ſurely the hand of God went not out againſt them for any ſpeciall provocation upon them, but upon account of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bringing about ſome notable things that are in the heart of God, which time muſt manifeſt: therefore though the falling of many Saints may ſpeak, that the Lord is diſpleaſed with his People, yet I would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſay concerning many of them (and it may be a caution unto us) as Chriſt, <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ye that theſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Galileans, becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh;</hi> or thoſe eighteen upon whom the Tower in <hi>Shiloe</hi> fell, and ſlew them, think ye that they were ſinners above all others that dwelt in <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> I tell you nay, but except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh: though many of the Saints may poſſibly have fallen through great provocations, yet ſurely for others we muſt not reckon them ſinners above the reſt of the Saints that remain.</p>
               <p>Obj. 7. If it be asked, <hi>May we conclude that all the Iſrael of God that have eſcaped, and may eſcape through Grace, that they do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41272:61"/>eſcape becauſe they have been found walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uprightly with God, in a conſtant exerciſe of Grace, do they therefore eſcape becauſe they are found in right and good frames of ſoul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that I anſwer: Let us <hi>not be high-minded, but fear.</hi> Though poſſibly ſome of the Saints that ſtand, God hath found them in a right Spirit, and is therefore pleaſed to ſpare, yet for many of us we muſt put our preſervation upon ſome other ſcore; I would rather place it where the Spirit of God doth ſometimes place the preſervation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 78. <hi>But he being full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, forgave their iniquities; yea, many a time turned away his Anger, and did not ſtir up all his Wrath.</hi> I do rather ſuppoſe that moſt of us that live, live through the grace and indulgence of a tender-hearted God, becauſe he doth not ſtir up all his Wrath, rather than becauſe we have been found in this right and excellent Spirit which this day calls for, and which of right ſhould have been found upon us. And thus I have ſhewed that in dayes of ſlaughter all of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> may not eſcape, and why.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to the ſecond Branch for proſecution of this Doctrine, to ſhew that whoever ſtand or fall, Chriſt will loſe none of his glory, that all ſlaughtering-providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall end in the making Chriſt glorious;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41272:62"/>
                  <hi>In that day ſhall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious:</hi> that is, in that day when ſome great and dreadful Slaughters are brought to a concluſion; as is evident if you conſider and compare it with what goes before in the third chapter. Certainly a little light into Scripture is enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us, that God hath brought forth many great things for his own glory and the good of his People, by ſlaughters; it were eaſie to obſerve unto you that moſt of the great things that God hath done for his Name and People, have been effected and brought about by great diſtreſſes: <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſet free from their oppreſſion, which was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent mercy, and how? Slaughters were made to bring that about; <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Moſes ſaid unto the People, Fear ye not, ſtand ſtill, and ſee the Salvation of the Lord, which he will ſhew unto you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have ſeen to day, ye ſhall ſee them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain no more for ever.</hi> And you ſhall finde they were poſſeſſed of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſetled in that good Land, but which way? it was by and through great ſlaughters; the Canaanite was diſperſed and driven out, and it was by cutting them off; yea, I do ſuppoſe that one of the means and wayes by which God made way for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſet them in <hi>Canaan,</hi> was by the Peſtilence; I gather it from that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41272:62"/>
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.23. <hi>My Angel ſhall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perriſites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebuſites, and I will cut them off.</hi> God ſaith he would ſend his Angel to do it. The Angels of God work many wayes; but that that is eminently called in Scripture the ſtroke of the Angel, it is that ſtroke by the Peſtilence, as many inſtances might make it good; and I the rather judge it to be the intent of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, becauſe it is ſaid in verſ. 25. <hi>You ſhall ſerve the Lord your God, and he ſhall bleſs thy bread and thy water, and I will take ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs away from the midſt of thee:</hi> The Angel ſhall cut off the Canaanites, but I ſhall take ſickneſs away from thee. And if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what God hath promiſed to do for his People in the time to come, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.6, 7. you find cauſe to believe that this is the way that God delights to take; <hi>The Lord exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth Righteouſneſs and Judgment for all that are oppreſſed; he made known his wayes unto Moſes, and his acts unto the children of Iſrael.</hi> Mark, God ſaith he will act for his People, he will free them from oppreſſion, from bonds, and from troubles; but how? <hi>He made known his wayes unto Moſes, and his acts to the children of Iſrael.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>How?</hi> I will tell you, and God hath told
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41272:63"/>you long ago; he told <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not onely what he would do for them in their day, but what he would do, and how he would proceed for good unto his People in after-dayes. In the dayes of <hi>Moſes</hi> God wrought for his People and led them into much good by ſlaughter, and this is the way that God ſtill intends to take. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72. entituled <hi>A Pſalm for Solomon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the glory that was put upon <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Solomon</hi> Chriſt is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently intended, and his Glory and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is eminently pointed at; obſerve which way it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come to their Glory, and come to do good to his People; <hi>He ſhall judge the Poor of his People, he ſhall ſave the children of the Needy, he ſhall break in pieces the Oppreſſors;</hi> it is in a way of ſlaughter. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Scriptures more that I might name, you ſhall find there what the Lord ſaith he will do; <hi>There ſhall be upon every high hill, rivers and ſtreams of waters, in the day of the great ſlaughter, when the Towers ſhall fall:</hi> Saith God, <hi>there ſhall be a day of great ſlaughter;</hi> What ſhall the ſlaughter do? <hi>the Towers ſhall fall;</hi> which are types and repreſentations of the high great things of this World, that ſeem to have great ſtrength, and to be almoſt impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41272:63"/>But <hi>in the day of great ſlaughter the Towers ſhall fall:</hi> And what will the effect thereof be? it will be glory to Chriſt, and good unto his People; ver. 26. <hi>it is in the dayes that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his People, in which the light of the Moon ſhal be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun ſhall be ſeven-fold, as the light of ſeven days:</hi> Thus will Chriſt glorifie himſelf and do his People good by ſlaughter. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.6. he gives you an account of dreadful ſlaughter, <hi>The Sword of the Lord is filled with Blood, it is made fat with fatneſs, and with the Blood of Lambs and Goats, with the fat of the Kidneys of Rams: for the Lord hath a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in Bozrah, and a great ſlaughter in the land of Idumea:</hi> Here ſhall be great ſlaughter, and what ſhall be the effect of it? you ſhall ſee in the 12th verſ. <hi>They ſhall call the Nobles thereof unto the Kingdom, but none ſhall be there, and all her Princes ſhall be nothing;</hi> that is, the glory that ſhall come to Chriſt ſhall ſo out-ſhine and out-do the glory of all the great Ones of the World, that they ſhall be look'd upon as if they were not, his glory that ſhall come to him through the ſlaughter ſhall ſo ſurpaſs them in all their glory. I might add <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.10, &amp;c. <hi>The Earth mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and languiſheth, Lebanon is aſhamed and hewn down, Sharon is like a Wilderneſs, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41272:64"/>Baſhan and Carmel ſhake off their fruits; Now will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord, now will I be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, now will I lift up my ſelf:</hi> Now look what follows, and you ſhall find the way by which he will be exalted, it is through ſlaughter; <hi>Ye ſhall conceive chaff, ye ſhall bring forth ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, your breath as fire ſhall devour you, and the People ſhall be as the burning of Lime, as Thorns cut up, they ſhall be burnt in fire:</hi> Ah my Friends! we may think our ſelves ſecure and out of danger, becauſe upon our feet; but alas, Chriſt that is to make himſelf glorious, how eaſily is he able to pull down the pride of man, and to lay low his lofty looks? it is a notable word that you have <hi>Job</hi> 24.22, <hi>&amp;c. He draweth alſo the Mighty with his power; when He riſeth up,</hi> (mark, that is to plead his Cauſe) <hi>no man is ſure of his life; though it be given him to be in ſafety whereon he reſteth, yet his Eyes are upon their Ways.</hi> Men may think themſelves ſafe and ſecure, and that which is their ſtrength and confidence may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched for the preſent, but yet the Lords Eyes are upon their ways; and verſ. 24. <hi>They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low, they are taken out of the way</hi> (it is done in a little time) <hi>as the tops of the Ears of Corn:</hi> Thoſe that ſtand in the way of Chriſts Exaltation, they are exalted, but it is but for a little while; and in a little while,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41272:64"/>at ſhort warning, Chriſt can throw them down, and cut them off as the tops of the Ears of Corn. You know a little thing will ſtrike of the top of an Ear of Corn, when it is fully ripe; Chriſt can with a little ſtroke make all glory to periſh, that his own may be advanced. So that I ſay it is Chriſt's way and method to get himſelf glory, and do his People good by Slaughter; yea, let me tell you, This Plague and Peſtilence is a means by which God will work out his own glory; We, it may be, look upon it as a thing that comes of courſe once in forty years, or ſuch a matter; but truly this is a ſad mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and in the 89th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> a Pſalm in which <hi>David</hi> is much concerned, but in and under the Perſon of <hi>David,</hi> Chriſt is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and God when he promiſeth the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>David,</hi> that he would ſecure the Kingdom unto him, he intends Chriſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that he would make Chriſt great and glorious in the World; and which way will he do it? verſ. 23. <hi>And I will beat down his Foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. Junius</hi> renders the word thus, <hi>Oſores ejus plagâ afficiam;</hi> we may tranſlate it, <hi>I will ſmite them that hate him:</hi> for, <hi>plaga,</hi> a ſtroke, is put for any kinde of ſtroke or ſmiting, but properly and more eſpecially, for this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Plague; and I think ſo it is to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41272:65"/>be taken here; I will ſend this Judgement abroad, that I may cut off and take away the haters of my Son, that I may eſtabliſh him in the glory that I have deſigned for him. To which add <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.2. where the Prophet petitions the Lord, <hi>O Lord, I have heard thy ſpeech and was afraid; O Lord revive thy work in the midſt of the years, in the midſt of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy: God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran, his glory covered the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;</hi> (that is, God came forth to work the Exaltation of his Son) and what courſe doth he take in order to it? verſ. 5. <hi>Before him went the Peſtilence, and burning Coals went forth at his feet:</hi> The Peſtilence is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fore-runner of Chriſts Exaltation; he ſends it before him to make room and way for himſelf, though we poſſibly, and our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities are too ſhallow to conceive how it ſhould be brought about: It is poſſible, if God let us ſtand upon the Earth ſome few years, we may be much more enlightened in this matter, and may ſee that God was this day eminently working to that end.</p>
               <p>And that is what I would ſay to that Head, That Slaughter, and ſlaughtering-Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, work for and ſhall end in the making Chriſt glorious.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:41272:65"/>
               <p>Thirdly, What is that glory that ſhall be put on Chriſt in the iſſue and end of theſe things?</p>
               <p>I anſwer in a few particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Eſſential Glory of Chriſt, in the day of his Glory, ſhall be more abundantly ſeen and diſcovered then now it is, and ſhall take more upon the hearts of all Perſons. Chriſt is as glorious in his Eſſential Glory as can be, for he is infinitely glorious, and more then infinite cannot be imagined; but this Glory may be diſcover'd and manifeſted beyond what it is: The Sun is always a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body, but you know the light of it is hid many times, Clouds ſtand between, and we cannot ſee it at ſome times as we can at others. Chriſt is exceedingly glorious, but little of his Glory hath been hitherto manifeſted to the Children of Men; more Eyes ſhall ſee it, and more Hearts be taken with it then at this day. Something of Chriſts Glory is ſeen already by the Saints, who have a ſpiritual Eye, they ſee that that takes their Hearts, and makes them cry out, as the Spouſe ſometimes doth, <hi>He is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lovely:</hi> Some of the Saints ſee that in Chriſt which is more to them then all that is in this World; they take more comfort and content in it, more of joy and ſatisfaction to their Spirits. When Chriſt came in the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41272:66"/>Fleſh, it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, and we ſaw his Glory, the Glory as of the onely begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth.</hi> That Glory that we do for the preſent behold in Chriſt, and with which our hearts are taken, it is rather (for the moſt part) that fulneſs of Grace that is in Chriſt, for the good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Believers; with that we are uſually more taken then with his Eſſential Perſonal Perfections: But the whole of Jeſus Chriſts Glory ſhall yet ſhine forth ſo as it hath not done at any time; therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16. <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up Sion, he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Glory:</hi> He is glorious now, but <hi>he ſhall appear</hi> in his Glory hereafter, beyond what he hath done at any time to this day: ſuitable unto which, is that Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.17. <hi>Thine Eyes ſhall ſee the King in his Beauty, they ſhall behold the Land that is very far off.</hi> The beſt of Saints upon Earth, if they ſee ſomething in Chriſt that makes them in love with him, in the day of his Glory there ſhall be abundantly more diſcovered that ſhall make them in love with him, poſſibly more then ever they thought they ſhould be for ever. That is one part of that Glory ſhall come to this Branch of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt ſhall in the end of this ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be made glorious in his Prieſtly Office;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41272:66"/>as he is a Saviour he ſhall be made more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then ever: It is the honour of Chriſt that he is a Saviour, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour:</hi> But it hath been greatly to the diſparagement of Chriſt, and his diſhonour in this his Office that he hath been ſo lightly eſteemed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Children of Men, that ſo few have taken hold of him for Life and Salvation: Thoſe that have believed on Chriſt have been a ſmall number, compared with the reſt of the world, and of theſe few, they have been chiefly the poor, low and little ones of the World, perſons of little eſteem and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.5. <hi>The Poor have the Goſpel preached unto them:</hi> he ſaith it is preached to them, becauſe it is received by them: the poor, inconſiderable ones of the World, have generally hitherto been the perſons that have received Chriſt: It is true, ſome of the Great Ones of the World have courted Chriſt, and profeſſed to own him, but not one of many have given up themſelves unto Chriſt as a Saviour. But now this ſhall be the Glory upon the head of Chriſt, that Souls ſhall abundantly flock in unto him. Before Chriſt makes an end of his work in the World, he will ſo break the Hearts of Men, that they ſhall flow in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in great abundance: <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7. <hi>And I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41272:67"/>will ſhake all Nations, and the Deſire of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall come; and I will fill this Houſe with Glory, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> Chriſt by his Sword, Peſtilence and Famine, is ſhaking the Nations, that is his way; and when he hath done ſhaking the Nations, <hi>the Deſire of all Nations ſhall come:</hi> It is Chriſt is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and he is called the <hi>Deſire of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> becauſe the Nations of the World ſhall generally come unto him, and imbrace him, ſuch ſhall be the confluence and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in to Chriſt. This is intimated in that known place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.8. <hi>Who are theſe that fly as a Cloud, and as the Doves unto their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows?</hi> It is ſpoken about the acceſs of Souls unto Chriſt; and mark, the Saints that ſhall be alive at that day, they cry with wonder and amazement, <hi>Who are theſe that like Doves come to their Windows?</hi> Doves you know fly in great flocks, where they are plentiful, and the meaning of this is, multitudes ſhall ſubject themſelves to Chriſt in truth, and give up themſelves to be ſaved by him; Chriſt now doth ſprinkle many Nations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. here and there a few Souls in divers parts and places of the world; but at length things ſhall be ſo ordered that even a Nation ſhall be born in a day, and abundance of poor Hearts ſhall give up themſelves unto the Lord Jeſus: This you
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41272:67"/>have <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.7. <hi>He ſhall pour the water out of his Buckets, and his ſeed ſhall be in many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and his King ſhall be higher then Agag.</hi> And this is another part of the Glory that is to come unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Slaughter ſhall terminate in the Glory of Chriſt, in this reſpect; He ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Kingly Power, he ſhall be owned as the Head, and Lord, and Law-giver, the one onely Law-giver; ſo ſhall he be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. <hi>For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, he will ſave us.</hi> It relates unto a time when Chriſt ſhall be glorious: <hi>The glorious Lord ſhall be as a place of Broad Rivers and Streams;</hi> ſo you have it in the foregoing verſe; and then there ſhall be a cry, <hi>The Lord is our King, and he ſhall be our Law-giver.</hi> For the preſent there is great debate between Chriſt and the Men of the World, who ſhould give Laws, whoſe Prerogative it is to rule the Conſcience; and men ſay unto Saints, <hi>Bow down that we may go over:</hi> they ſay unto the SOULS of Saints, <hi>Bow down:</hi> But when Chriſt ſhall be made glorious, theſe controverſies ſhall ſoon end; then a Nation ſhall come and acknowledge it is Chriſt is to rule them in every thing. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. decides the Controverſie, where more then once it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ALONE ſhall be exalted;</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:41272:68"/>and what then? verſ. 3. <hi>Many People ſhall go and ſay, Come ye, and let us go up unto the Mountain of the Lord, to the Houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Sion ſhall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Jeruſalem: and he ſhall judge among the Nations, and ſhall rebuke many People.</hi> This is the Spirit that ſhall be put upon many People, and they ſhall ſay, It is not this, and that, and the other, that pretends Dominion over the Conſcience, muſt teach us how to walk, but HE will teach us, and we will walk in his ways; and it is <hi>out of Sion the Law ſhall go forth, and the Word of the Lord from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> therefore <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.7. it is ſaid, <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael's King ſhall be higher then Agag,</hi> and ſhall carry the day, and all the men of the Earth ſhall be conſtrained to ſubmit to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt ſhall be glorious in this reſpect, That all the Great Ones of the World ſhall come and fall at his Foot, and acknowledge they are in his hands, that Chriſt can and may diſpoſe of them as he pleaſeth. It is a buſineſs there is much tugging about in the World, the Great Ones of the World are loth Chriſt ſhould take his place, they would fain ſtand upon their own legs, and it is from hence all their contrariety and hatred againſt his People and Ways doth ariſe, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41272:68"/>in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.3. <hi>The Kings of the Earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſaying, Let us break their Bands aſunder, and caſt away their Cords from us.</hi> They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of ſtooping unto Chriſt, but it is in vain, for to this the greateſt on Earth ſhall be brought; therefore Chriſt hath his Name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.16. <hi>He hath on his Veſture and on his Thigh, a Name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS:</hi> It is written upon his Veſture and Garments, which is in the ſight and full view of all Men: He ſhall be in the ſight of the World owned as KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS, and the greateſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth ſhall be conſtrained to ſtoop unto him, as is excellently ſet forth in that typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Pſalm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. where Chriſts Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is much held out; <hi>The Kings of Tarſhiſh and of the Iſles ſhall bring Preſents, the Kings of Sheba and Seba ſhall offer gifts; yea all Kings ſhall fall down before him, all Nations ſhall ſerve him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, The Glory of Chriſt ſhall lie in the maintaining and excellent managing of his Power and Government; he ſhall maintain his Government and Glory: It is that that eclipſes the glory of the Princes of this Earth, that they are not able to keep
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41272:69"/>their ſtations oft times; but Chriſt ſhall keep and maintain, and make good his ground: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.18. <hi>His Enemies will I cloath with ſhame, but upon himſelf ſhall the Crown flouriſh:</hi> Thoſe that would oppoſe him ſhall fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, but he ſhall maintain his own ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at a glorious rate. And likewiſe his Glory ſhall be in the management of his Government, he will put an end to Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and judge with Equity; he will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his Government ſo as that none ſhall find fault with him: It is the miſery of the Potentates of this World, that their ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their Power, loſeth them their Glory; but Chriſt, and all that ſhall have any power under him, ſhall not do ſo; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.1. <hi>A King ſhall reign in Righteouſneſs, and Princes ſhall rule in Judgement:</hi> all matters ſhall then be managed with much equity and uprightneſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a notable Scripture for this, <hi>There ſhall come forth a Rod out of the Stem of Jeſſe,</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>the Spirit of the Lord and of Wiſdom ſhall be upon him:</hi> there is his Glory, when he comes to govern he ſhall do things with wiſdom, that is Wiſdom really, for the Wiſdom of this World comes to nothing, and the ends of the Men of the World are not accompliſhed; but Chriſt ſhall rule with Wiſdom, and alſo with Equity, verſ. 4. <hi>With Righteouſneſs ſhall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41272:69"/>he judge the Poor, and reprove with Equity for the Meek of the Earth.</hi> Now Chriſts thus managing of his Government, will render him very glorious: Which leads me to the fourth thing propounded.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That Chriſt in his being glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſhall be glorious for the good of his <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that ſhall be carried tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the diſtreſſes and ſtraights they ſhall meet withal in the World, they ſhall ſhare in, and partake of all the Glory of Chriſt with much comfort: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.7. it is there ſaid, <hi>In his days ſhall the righteous flouriſh:</hi> when it is well with him, it ſhall not be ill with them: So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. where it is ſaid, ver. 23. Chriſt ſhall <hi>reign in Mount Zion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Antients gloriouſly;</hi> and you ſhall ſee, verſ. 16. how it will be with his People, <hi>From the uttermoſt parts of the Earth have I heard Songs, even Glory to the Righteous:</hi> When Chriſt ſhall be glorified, his People ſhall be glorified with him. If the Saints ſay unto Chriſt, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Butler, <hi>Remeber me when it is well with thee;</hi> their Deſires ſhall be anſwered at a better rate then <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s were. When Chriſt ſhall be made glorious in the World, as he ſhall be one day, he will not be one day without his Peoples reaping the good and benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41272:70"/>and it muſt needs be thus; for conſider Firſt the Union between Chriſt and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Chriſt is the Head and Husband of his Saints. And Civilians ſay, <hi>Uxor lucet Mariti radiis,</hi> the Wife partakes of the honour of her Husband; ſo it ſhall be here, the Saints ſhall partake of and reap the good of that honour that ſhall be upon the Head of Chriſt; Chriſt is ſo full of love to his People, that the very love he bears them, were there no other tie, would engage him to intereſt them in the good of his Glory; Chriſt is the Head and his People are the Members, and if the Head be dignified, all the Members muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; it cannot be otherwiſe. Secondly, Chriſts Glory muſt needs be for the good of his People, in that all the Glory he is intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with, as Mediator, it is in their names, for their ſakes, and for their uſes; he is <hi>Head over all things to his Church,</hi> Eph. 1.22. I may therefore ſay unto Saints, as they in <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Go forth, O ye Daughters of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and behold King Solomon with the Crown wherewith his Mother crowned him in the day of his Eſpouſals, in the day of the gladneſs of his Heart:</hi> Go forth and look upon, by the Eye of Faith, that Glory that ſhall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Head of Chriſt, and look upon it with comfort; you may account it a joyous ſpectacle, for it is that that ſhall work out
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41272:70"/>your Mercy, if your hearts be upright with God. A little further to ſhew you what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit ſhall come unto Saints by Chriſts being glorious.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When Chriſt is glorious, glorious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſhall come unto the Saints: We are now a company of inthralled Creatures, not only unto our own luſts, but the luſts of men; you have a notable expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. <hi>The Creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God:</hi> The Creatures of the Earth are now in bondage unto the luſts of Men: our Rayment is in bondage to our Pride, our Meat to Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, our Drink to Drunkenneſs; and other things the like: the Creatures are held in ſlavery unto the luſts of Men; but there is a time when they ſhall have glorious Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when men ſhall not be able at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to inthrall and oppreſs them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.12, 14. the Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of Chriſt in his glory, ſaith of him, That <hi>he ſhall deliver the Needy when he crieth, the Poor alſo, and him that hath no helper; he ſhall redeem their Souls from death and violenee, and precious ſhall their Blood be in his ſight.</hi> It is worth your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that the whole deſign of Chriſt is but to do his People good, to ſave them; and therefore at the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of that Pſalm it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall ſave the Children of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41272:71"/>needy;</hi> and particularly this ſervice he ſhall do them, he ſhall give them glorious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſhall be their Glory, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſhall be wiped away; the People of God have been a reproached People greatly reproached, but their reproach ſhall be rolled away. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to <hi>Canaan</hi> they were circumciſed, and the place where they were circumciſed was called <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and the reaſon given, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.9. <hi>For there he rolled away the reproach of Egypt;</hi> the lot of the Saints is to be reproached in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but there ſhall be a time and day, and a Place alſo, which he will name <hi>Gilgal,</hi> a time and place when and where he will roll away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his People. For the preſent ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God gives his People unto reproach, as you have it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.28. <hi>Therefore I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned the Princes of the Sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curſe, and Iſrael to reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> but there is alſo a time when reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhall be taken away, <hi>Then will the Lord be jealous for his Land, and pity his People, yea the Lord will anſwer and ſay unto his People, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will ſend you Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, and ye ſhall be ſatisfied therewith, and I will no more make you a reproach among the Heathen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Glory of the Saints ſhall be this, They ſhall be raiſed up to much height and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41272:71"/>dignity, that the greateſt of all the ungodly ones of the Earth ſhall bow before them; for which take one place inſted of many, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.14. <hi>The Sons alſo of them that afflicted thee, ſhall come bending unto thee; and all they that deſpiſed thee, ſhall bow themſelves down at the ſoals of thy feet; and they ſhall call thee, The City of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Iſrael:</hi> It were great arrogancy for any of the Saints to hope for ſuch a thing as this, had not God ſpoken it; and it is as great infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity not to believe it, ſince the mouth of the Lord hath uttered it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſhall have this Glory, More e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and uninterupted Communion with God and Chriſt, then ever yet they had; and this is the thing that every good Soul longs for: long for it they do, that is certain; and when they are hinder'd in that enjoyment, it is their great burthen; when their Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are taken down, their communion's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, this is that that makes them go mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but the Lord will give his People more eminent and glorious communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Son, then they have yet parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. It is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.7. with reſpect to a time yet to come, <hi>The Flocks of Kedar ſhall be gathered together unto thee, the Rams of Nebaioth ſhall miniſter unto thee; they ſhall come up with acceptance on mine Altar, and I
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41272:72"/>will glorifie the Houſe of my Glory.</hi> Obſerve it, the Glory of the Temple of old was the preſence of God in the Temple, he was ſaid to <hi>fill the Houſe with his Glory;</hi> the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the Saints had with God, was the Temple-Glory, God meeting with them in his Appointments and Adminiſtrations; and now he promiſeth here, <hi>I will glorifie the Houſe of my Glory;</hi> I will fill my Churches and Saints with more Glory then yet they have ſeen; the meaning is, they ſhall have more of my preſence with them, and more abundant communion and fellowſhip with me, then heretofore: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.11. it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall be delighted with the abundance of her Glory, that ye may ſuck and be ſatisfied with the Breſts of her Conſolation, that ye may milk out and be delighted with the abundance of her Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And in the laſt place, this ſhall be the Glory of Saints, Even their glorious Union one with another, and this ſhall be their mercy in the day of Chriſt; in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.8, 9. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Therefore wait ye upon me, until the day that I riſe up unto the prey, for my determination is to gather the Nations, that I may aſſemble the Kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the Earth ſhall be devoured with the fire of my jealouſie; for then will I turn to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41272:72"/>a pure language, that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent.</hi> It is the great cry among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, O that we could come to Unity, to love as Brethren! all cry for want of it, though few endeavour after it as they ought to do: but when we have done our utmoſt endeavours, (which is our Duty) yet it will not riſe up to any great height, till Chriſt come in his Glory: <hi>Wait upon ME until I ariſe to the prey,</hi> to do gloriouſly in the <hi>World,</hi> and then I will work thus and thus, that you may come to ſerve me with One Conſent. They miſtake greatly that think to force People to a Union, to make them all of one mind; it is the work of God to pour out a Spirit of Union, which he hath promiſed to do; <hi>The Lord ſhall be one, and his Name one, in all the Earth,</hi> Zach. 4. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. <hi>I will give them one Heart, and one Way, to ſerve me.</hi> When Chriſt ſhall be advanced, our Diviſions ſhall be broken; and whatever the Devil and wicked Men have caſt in as a ſnare and means to rend and divide, ſhall be taken out of the way: It is then that we ſhall be enlightened in the things wherein we vary one from another: What is the ground of all our differences? they are part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorance, and partly pride; our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, we cannot ſee into Truth, one thinks
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41272:73"/>one thing, and another another, and becauſe we cannot ſee into every thing, we diſagree; which is furthered by our Pride, cleaving unto our own imaginations: but this will be removed, God will lay low the pride of men, and we ſhall have more light, we ſhall ſee that we never ſaw, and be enlightened as we never were: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.20. <hi>Thy Sun ſhall no more go down, neither ſhall thy Moon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it ſelf; for the Lord ſhall be thine ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Light, and the days of thy mourning ſhall be ended:</hi> The Lord ſhall at that day let us into the knowledge of much of his mind, which yet we grope in the dark without light in; and then there ſhall be a great Union among Saints. Now to all theſe ends, to the Glory of Chriſt, and good of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Chriſt is working by his ſlaughtering-Providences: Thoſe things that we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, and know not what they tend to, it is to that end they ſubſerve, and ſhall be crowned with that iſſue. And thus I have diſpatched what I intend for the Doctrinal part.</p>

My Friends, it ſtands you greatly in hand to be faithful and ſerious in this enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into your Spirits in this matter; for if you ſhould not be of the Iſrael of God, it would not onely rob you of much mercy you might enjoy in this life, it would not onely ſtrip you of a part in the good that ſhall come to the Iſrael of God when the Branch of the Lord ſhall be glorious, but what is more and what is worſe, it will cut you ſhort of the glory that ſhall be put upon the head of the Saints in Eternity, when Chriſt ſhall have given up the Kingdom to his Father, and God ſhall be all in all. Brethren, upon many ſerious thoughts I may tell you, that there is great ground why every Soul ſhould be jealous over his own heart, and ſhould not haſtily determine concerning its ſtate: Great are the miſtakes, falſe grounds, and bottoms of hope upon which many poor creatures build; and it concerns you to act curiouſly and warily, leſt you ſhould be alſo miſtaken.</p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:41272:75"/>
                  <p>To quicken you a little, and to poſſeſs your Souls that there is need, and great need, for poor hearts to have a jealouſie over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this matter; I would take leave to commend and open to you two Scriptures that I find in the Book of Truth: one is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7. <hi>Not as though the Word of God hath taken no effect; for they are not all Iſrael which are of Iſrael, neither becauſe they are the ſeed of Abraham are they all Children:</hi> Look to the fourth verſ. and you will finde that there are great Priviledges reckoned up that did appertain to <hi>Iſrael; Who are Iſrael, to whom pertaineth the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenant, and the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the Promiſes.</hi> How, might ſome of the Jews ſay, do theſe things belong unto <hi>Iſrael?</hi> why ſurely <hi>Iſrael</hi> are cut ſhort of them; for there is not one of many of them that have received Chriſt, and ſo are cut ſhort of theſe Priviledges of the Goſpel. To that the Apoſtle anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, verſ. 6, 7. <hi>Not as though the Word of God hath taken no effect; for they are not all Iſrael which are of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. as if he ſhould ſay, You muſt not judge that theſe great things are entailed upon the Jewiſh People becauſe they are Jews, or the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but it is through Faith they come to an Intereſt in theſe great things. And in theſe words
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41272:75"/>the Apoſtle doth remove a double bad Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon which many poor Creatures are apt to build a hope.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They are not Iſrael becauſe of Iſrael:</hi> that is, a Soul is not an Iſraelite indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he crowds himſelf in among that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe he takes up the ſame Profeſſion with them, and pretends to be in the ſame Spirit with them. Let it be minded, what is the Foundation of your Hope, think you? you are not therefore <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> becauſe of them that do profeſs for God, that will not be a foundation that is fit for you to build upon. And then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Neither are they Iſrael becauſe they are the Seed of Abraham:</hi> This was a mighty thing which the Jewiſh People boaſted of; ſay they, We are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, his Seed according to the fleſh: And poſſibly ſome alſo may reckon upon ſome ſuch thing at this day; we are the Children of them that do believe, and our education hath been ſomewhat ſuitable thereto; but not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iſrael, becauſe of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, that is a miſtake you ſhould be watchful againſt. From the conſideration of this word, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident People may reckon themſelves <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon unſafe grounds, and therefore we ought to be ſerious in our enquiry into this matter.</p>
                  <p>The other Scripture is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. where
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41272:76"/>you have the preceding things, and ſomewhat more expreſſed, verſ. 1, 2. <hi>Hear ye this, O Houſe of Jacob, which are called by the Name of Iſrael, and are come forth out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Judah, which ſwear by the Name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Iſrael, but not in truth, nor in righteouſneſs; for they call themſelves of the Holy City, and ſtay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the God of Iſrael, the Lord of Hoſts is his name.</hi> It is a Scripture worth your conſidering; and it doth in the general teach us thus much; That a People may be many things, and may do many things that do ſeemingly beſpeak them to be of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, but when the matter is more thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquired into, it will be found it is no ſuch thing. Take a few particulars out of the Text, and obſerve what perſons may be and do, and yet really not be the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They may be called by the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they may be reputed Saints, paſs for ſomewhat in the eſteem and account of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſuitable to which is that Scripture which you have, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. where the Spirit of God teſtifies concerning the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> that <hi>they had a name to live, but yet were dead:</hi> In the opinion of thoſe that did converſe with them, and that held commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, they were indeed alive;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41272:76"/>but when the Spirit of God came to paſs a ſentence on them, and to determine really what their ſtate was, ſays the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Thou art dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obſerve alſo that they were the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Jacob; Hear ye, O Houſe of Jacob, that are come forth out of the Waters of Judah:</hi> that is, you are ſome of the multitude of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>'s Off-ſpring; they were the ſeed of them that were in Covenant, but yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many of them were Strangers to the Lord, and not of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto this day. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you mind it, that Grace is not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and infallibly intailed upon every one of the Seed of Believers; although it is very frequently ſeen that ſome or other of their Seed the Lord is pleaſed to chuſe to himſelf, and does ſet them apart to be the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his praiſe, according to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.9. <hi>And their Seed ſhall be known among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and their Off-ſpring among the People; all that ſee them ſhall acknowledge them, that they are the Seed which the Lord hath bleſſed:</hi> not onely the Seed of them which the Lord hath bleſſed, but a Seed which are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bleſſed in their own perſons: It is the uſual method of the Lord, though he may paſs by ſome, yet he does take ſome other of the Seed, to bring them near to himſelf. But this I muſt let you know, you muſt no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41272:77"/>make reckoning of the intereſt of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the Covenant, but as a ground of Hope to you, and an argument to plead with God; you muſt not thence conclude, that you your ſelves are in the Bond of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, till ſome work be upon your hearts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They made a profeſſion for God, and therefore are ſaid to <hi>ſwear by the Name of the Lord.</hi> Swearing by the Name of the Lord is an act of Worſhip, a profeſſed owning of God, which ſhall be done by Saints, when they are found in the beſt Spirit, witneſs that word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.16. <hi>He that bleſſeth himſelf in the Earth ſhall bleſs himſelf in the God of truth; and he that ſweareth in the Earth ſhall ſwear by the God of Truth; becauſe the former troubles are forgotten, and are hid from thine eyes.</hi> It is ſpoken about times in which a great deal of mercy and good will be brought forth, and then there ſhall be ſwearing by the Name of the Lord; it is a profeſſed owning of God: and thus did this People do, and yet there was nothing of God in them, nothing of Truth, nothing but hypocriſie and deceit bound up in their Spirits.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Obſerve alſo they did reckon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were right in their own opinion and eſteem; they called themſelve the <hi>Holy City:</hi> It is a marvelous eaſie thing for a Soul to get a good opinion of himſelf,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41272:77"/>to ſtand right in his own apprehenſions; but I would not have you build too much upon this. It is an excellent caution which the Apoſtle gives, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>For I ſay, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himſelf more highly then he ought to think but to think ſoberly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God hath dealt to every man the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Faith:</hi> I ſay unto every man among <hi>YOU,</hi> (he ſpeaks unto Profeſſors) be not too haſty and forward to conclude well concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves, but let every man judge himſelf to be no more, then according to the meaſure of Grace he hath received. My Friends, be your Profeſſion what it will, and your approbation among others what it can, you are really no more, nor will you ſtand for more in the day of Chriſt, then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as there ſhall be ſomewhat of God found upon your Souls.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Obſerve alſo they had much confidence that God would own them, and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>They ſtay'd themſelves upon the God of Iſrael;</hi> they profeſs that they do act Faith on God, and are full of confidence that they ſhall be owned of God, and not rejected by him. But after all this, ſee what a character the Spirit of God gives of this People, v. 4. <hi>Becauſe I knew that thou art obſtinate, and thy Neck is an Iron ſinew, and thy Brow Braſs:</hi> a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41272:78"/>People very wretched and wicked, very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious againſt God, not in the leaſt ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting themſelves to God, and to his mind, after all the profeſſion they have made, and their pretence to be <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Seriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things, and tell me if there be not cauſe that each Soul of us ſhould fear, leſt we be found ſhort of that number.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, How may I gather ſome comfortable grounded concluſions that I am one of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God? I am an Eſcaped One this day, and would not be willing that I ſhould be ſtript of the bleſſing of this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, I would have the Mercy in mercy; and therefore how may I come to ſome comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hope, that I really am a <hi>Jew inwardly, and partake of the circumciſion that is of the Heart, whoſe praiſe is not of man, but of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer in a few things, the Lord make them really effectual upon your Souls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If thou art one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thou art one of another Spirit then the men of this world; the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God they are a diſtinct People, ſeparate from the reſt of the Earth, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in their Spirits eminently, in another Spirit then the men of this world be. What is ſaid concerning <hi>Caleb, Numb.</hi> 14.24. is truly applicable to every one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in ſome meaſure; <hi>But my Servant Caleb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ANOTHER SPIRIT with him,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41272:78"/>and hath followed me fully,</hi> &amp;c. There were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Iſraelites in the Camp at that day, but few of them were in the frames they ſhould be in; <hi>Caleb was of another Spirit,</hi> and ſuch is every Saint: The Searcher of all hearts knows that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the world: Not a Saint in the world, but hath ſome ground to make an appeal to God, as ſometimes the Pſalmiſt doth, <hi>Search me and try me, and know my thoughts;</hi> and to appeal to the Lord, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did, <hi>Thou knoweſt my heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, O Lord. Iſaac</hi> had been begging Seed for his <hi>Rebecca,</hi> becauſe ſhe had been long barren; at length it is ſaid, <hi>There was ſtrugling in her Womb;</hi> ſhe wondered what it ſhould mean; but ſee what anſwer the Spirit of God makes her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.22, 23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Two Nations are in thy Womb, and two manner of People ſhall be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from thy Bowels; and the one People ſhall be ſtronger then the other People, and the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger:</hi> The two manner of People, were <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> and I bring this, to tell you, that <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was after named <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo all in the ſame Spirit with him, they are another manner of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as it were another Nation, another thing then the men of this world are; there is an eminent difference and diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41272:79"/>
                     <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they are of different Spirits, and of a different language, as ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations differing one from another. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>We have not received the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God:</hi> This he ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Saints of God, they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the Spirit of the World, but another Spirit diſtinct and different from them. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I would put it to your Conſciences, and would ask you what the anſwer of your Souls is? What ground have you to conclude that there is another Spirit in you then that which is in the World? It may be your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are ſomewhat other then the practices of the World are; but grant it be ſo, yet if you are not in another Spirit alſo, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward frame and conſtitution of your Souls do not differ, you will not be found among the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God in the concluſion. Ah my Friends! poſſibly ſome of your Practices may not vary from the men of the World, poſſibly you can be vain with them that are vain, and prophane with them that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; if it be thus with you, you muſt rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon your ſelves to be of the brood of <hi>Eſau</hi> to this day. Obſerve the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>And be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds.</hi> What ſay you? Are you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41272:79"/>to this World? Do you drive the trade, and take the courſe that the men of this World do? Are you vain, and frothy, and fooliſh, giving up your ſelves to ſerve divers luſts? Youth is ſubject to be ſo, and if it be thus with you, you are not of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to this day: But if you ſay, We are not of this World, we do not act as they do, we do not live as they do; then let me ask you, Are you transformed? It is well not to be conformed to this World, but that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, you muſt be transformed, and your Spirits renewed; you muſt be of another Spirit then the men of this World. I would beſeech you to look well to your hearts, and commune with your Souls, and do it not ſlightly: I know many (and would wail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them) that notwithſtanding their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for God, and their talking much of him, and being high in an external owning of <hi>God,</hi> yet in their walking (and therefore ſure much more in their ſpirits) they vary little from the men of this World: If it be thus with you, though you are eſcaped this day, yet you cannot comfortably conclude you are of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, or that you ſhall bear a part in that mercy and good they ſhall enjoy, when the Branch of the Lord ſhall be glorious.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Are you <hi>Iſrael</hi> indeed? then there is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41272:80"/>ſomewhat of Heart-cleanneſs in you; there is ſomewhat of cleanneſs of Heart, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Soul in you. Thus the Pſalmiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael, even to them that are of a clean Heart: God is good to Iſrael,</hi> he loves them, they are exceeding dear to him, and becauſe they are dear to him, therefore it is he is good to them: But who are the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi> They are a certain ſort of People that do not onely put on an external garb of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, a pretence for God, and his work, and ſervice, and glory; but a People that have ſome inward conformity and likeneſs to <hi>God;</hi> who have ſome cleanneſs of heart, as well as of hands and face. Man by nature is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impure creature, polluted grievouſly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed all over, all the Soul, all the Powers and Faculties of it are ſtained and grievouſly polluted, and therefore Sinners are in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called the <hi>Impure;</hi> and Saints, by way of diſtinction from them, are called <hi>Pure.</hi> A ſad account it is that the Apoſtle gives of Sinners, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the pure all things are pure, but to the undefiled and unbelieving is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pure, and their very conſciences are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt deſcribing the perſons that ſhall ſee God to their comfort and joy, he calls them <hi>the pure in heart,</hi> Mat. 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41272:80"/>there are that would pretend to this puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but it is peculiar and proper to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God onely, it is the iſſue and fruit of a new work upon the heart; it is the bleſſed effect of the Grace of God in and through the Covenant of Grace, the making good of the Promiſe which he hath paſſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and you ſhall be clean; from all your filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you; a new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will I put within you; and I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you a Heart of fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are them who are really impure, and grievouſly polluted, and yet think all is well with them, witneſs that known word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.12, 13. <hi>There is a Generation that is pure in their own eyes, and yet is not waſhed from their filthineſs: There is a Generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eye-lids are lifted up.</hi> There are ſome Souls greatly confident of their own purity, and yet defiled woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: While they boaſt of their freedom, and brag of their purity, and are crying to others it may be, <hi>Stand by thy ſelf, for I am holier then thou;</hi> they become after this Servants to Corruption.</p>
                  <p>Others there are in whom a cleanſing-work is really begun, but becauſe there are
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41272:81"/>ſome remains of corruption in their Souls, it fills their hearts ſo much with grief, and blinds their eyes ſo much, that they cannot ſee the cleanſing that is begun. To clear this therefore I muſt tell you, That where there is really heart-purity, there is much of the love of purity: If thou haſt not attained what of it thou wouldeſt, yet thy heart is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in love with it: <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that loveth pureneſs of Heart, for the grace of his Lips the King ſhall be his Friend.</hi> There are a People it may be have not attained to that pureneſs of heart they would do, but yet pureneſs of heart they love, and Grace is poured into their Lips; to ſuch the King will be a Friend, they ſhall find a Friend of Chriſt, and he will not be aſhamed to own them in the day of his greateſt Glory, when the Crown ſhall be ſet upon his Head. Not a Soul in whom purity is, but he is preſſing after it in greater meaſure; though he has not attained it, yet he does not ſit down and cry, There is no hope for me; but he is going forward, and preſſing after more of the Image of God to be implanted in his Soul. Now what is the anſwer of your Hearts? Can you from hence conclude comfortably, you are ſome of <hi>Gods Iſrael?</hi> Are the luſts that boil up in your hearts, fomented and cheriſhed, favoured and allowed, ſerved and pleaſed?
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41272:81"/>If ſo, it is ſad with you: If you lie in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of any Luſt, as in the lap of a <hi>Delilah:</hi> if thou ſayeſt of any ſin in thy Soul, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Lot</hi> ſaid concerning his <hi>Zoar, I cannot eſcape to the Mountains, but there is a City near, is it not a little one? let me flee thither, and I ſhall live:</hi> All the Cities of the Plain were doomed to deſtruction at that day, but <hi>Lot</hi> was earneſt to prevail for the ſaving of one little City, that he might delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it. There is not a luſt in thy Soul but it is doomed to deſtruction, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it ſhould be put to death; but poſſibly thou ſayeſt of it, O ſpare it, it is a little one. Let me be faithful to thee, and tell thee, that that ſin will be enough to race out thy name out of the Catalogue of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; and when others will ſtand with comfort, that have eſcaped this day, thou wilt be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and confounded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Art thou of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God? Then thou art one that haſt learned in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to live upon God. As it is the certain property of, ſo it is a great excellency in the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, that they live upon him; and this was as eminently found in <hi>Jacob,</hi> as ever in any one of the Servants of the Lord: When he was going to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> not knowing what ſhould befall him; obſerve how he ſpeaks, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Jacob vowed a Vow,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41272:82"/>ſaying, If God will be with me and keep me in this way that I go, and will give Bread to eat, and Rayment to put on,</hi> &amp;c. The great thing about which he was ſolicitous, was, that he might have the preſence of God. He had a little before in this Chapter a moſt glorious Viſion of God; (and I muſt confeſs Viſions of God are exceeding effectual to teach and work up the heart to a living upon <hi>God</hi>) and what does <hi>Jacob</hi> now ſay? If he might have but God to live upon, a very little of other matters ſhould content him; <hi>Bread to eat,</hi> ſomewhat that might ſupport his nature, and <hi>Rayment to put on,</hi> enough to cover him, and keep him warm; he doth not ſay, If I may have Varieties and Dainties to eat, and may be decked in coſtly Apparel; no, but onely <hi>Bread to eat, and Rayment to put on:</hi> If I can have but God, a little of the World will ſerve my turn. This is the Spirit of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that with which I doubt very few are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. I muſt crave leave to put this to all your Souls, and ask you what is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of your hearts? Can you ſay upon good grounds, as the Church of God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid, <hi>The Lord is my Portion, ſaith my Soul? Lam.</hi> 3.24. Suppoſe, ſhould Satan take you, as once he did Chriſt, and ſet you upon a <hi>high Mountain, and ſhew you the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World, and the Glory of them, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41272:82"/>tell you, All theſe things you ſhall have, if you will forgo and part with God?</hi> What would the anſwer of your hearts be in that caſe? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Chriſt ſhould come and ſay to you, <hi>If you will have a part in me, you muſt expect trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; you ſhall be hated of all men for my Names ſake; yea, the Parents from whoſe Bowels ye ſprang, ſhall turn againſt you:</hi> Can you ſay, <hi>Amen, ſo be it; Let me have the Lord for my Portion, and I can forgo all other things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever?</hi> This is <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Spirit, and ſo far as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s thus with you, it is right. What excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency have you ſeen in the Lord at any time? How have your hearts been taken with him? What are the workings of your Souls toward him? What are you labouring after? Is it that you may know God and enjoy him? What is it doth relieve you in the time of your ſtraights? Is it this, that the Lord is yours? It was <hi>David</hi>'s comfort when all went againſt him, when <hi>Ziklag</hi> was burnt, his Wives and all were taken, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpake of ſtoning him, he then encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf in the Lord his God. What is it that ſweetens all your enjoyments to you? Is it this, That you have a part in that which is better then all theſe, that you have a part in the Lord, and he is become your God and Father in Chriſt? Happy, yea, thrice happy are you that can ſay as once <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>The
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41272:83"/>Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ordered in all things, and ſure; and this is my Salvation, and this is all my Joy.</hi> But O unhappy they, who are not able to ſubſiſt without their Thouſands, and look upon themſelves as undone for ever, if worldly Intereſt runs but a little againſt them: And unhappy you, if in your Youth and Strength you have few thoughts, or few ſerious thoughts of God; if he be little in your thoughts and hearts, I tell you it is to be feared you are not of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God unto this day: Though you eſcape and are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet it is to be feared your preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not be attended with mercy to you, nor ſhall you bear a part in that Glory that ſhall be upon the heads of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the Branch of the Lord ſhall be glorious.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you are the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, then are you Holineſs to the Lord; you not onely live upon him, but to him, in ſome meaſure. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.9. the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Iſrael was Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Lord;</hi> that is, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in his right ſpirit, then he was Holineſs to the Lord. For the expreſſion, you have it in Scripture elſewhere, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.20, 21. <hi>In that day there ſhall be upon the Bells of the Horſes, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD, and the Pots in the Lords Houſe ſhall be like the Bowls before the Altar; yea, every Pot in Jeruſalem
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41272:83"/>and in Judah ſhall be Holineſs unto the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> that is, every Perſon and every Thing ſhall be for God, for his Work and Service, to be to his Praiſe and Glory. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, Saints are not their own, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price;</hi> and ſo <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13, 14. where ſpeaking concerning the purchaſe of Chriſt, <hi>Looking for the bleſſed hope and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing of the great God, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might purifie to himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works.</hi> The Veſſels of the Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were made uſe of in the Temple, they had a legal conſecrating, and being cleanſed, they were given up to the work of the Temple, to be for that uſe for ever: And ſo the Saints of the Lord, who were typified by the Veſſels of the Temple, they are firſt purified, cleanſed, and ſanctified by Chriſt, by the work of the Spirit on their Souls, and then given up to the Lord and his ſervice. It may be ſaid of them as <hi>Hannah</hi> ſaid of her Son <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Therefore I have lent him unto the Lord, to be his ſo long as he lives.</hi> Every Iſraelite indeed is one lent to the Lord, given up to be for the work and ſervice of the Lord in his whole courſe, and in every thing to exalt his praiſe, to mind his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41272:84"/>glory. Certainly thus it ought to be, and this was one end of the Death of Chriſt, that he might have his People be for him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>He died and roſe, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him that died for them and roſe again;</hi> and unto this Spirit Saints are wrought up in ſome good meaſure, as is expreſſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7. <hi>And none of us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>live to our ſelves.</hi> Souls, what ſay your Hearts to this matter? You profeſs for the Lord, but are you for him as conſecrated things in the Houſe of God? Which way do your Hearts work day by day? This know, where there hath not been a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn reſignation and giving up a mans ſelf unto the Lord, where there is not a diligent obſerving of a mans whole courſe, to ſee to what ends they are directed, and whether the glory of Chriſt be therein ſought, it is doubtful that Soul is not of the Iſrael of God to this day. The truth is, the ſins of many witneſs to their Faces, and I make no doubt but that inſcription may be written over the doors of many Profeſſors, upon too great ground, <hi>All men ſeek their own, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> If this be the ſpirit of any to whom theſe things may come, you may fear (though you are ſpared, and are not cut down this day) you ſtand but to cumber the ground, ſuch as God takes little delight
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41272:84"/>in, and ſuch as from whom he hath little fruit, ſuch as he doth not reckon among the number of his Iſrael, and ſuch as ſhall not be bleſſed with Iſraels mercies, when the Branch of the Lord ſhall be exalted.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Are you <hi>Iſrael?</hi> then are you a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People; <hi>Iſrael</hi> had thence his Name, from his wreſtling and prevailing with God; God asked him what was his Name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.27, 28. he ſaid, <hi>Jacob; and God ſaid, Thy Name ſhall no more be called Jacob, but Iſrael; for as a Prince haſt thou power with God and with men, and haſt prevailed.</hi> In his praying there is obſervable his importunity, and that is expreſſed partly when it is ſaid he <hi>wreſtled;</hi> and alſo in that expreſſion wherein much freedom and familiarity with God is ſet forth; God ſaid, <hi>Let me go;</hi> ſays <hi>Jacob, I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me,</hi> v. 26. which importunity of his is again noted by the Spirit of God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. <hi>He had power over the Angel, he wept and he made ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> There is alſo obſervable, that this Prayer it was in ſecret, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. <hi>And Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob was left ALONE;</hi> it was between the Lord and himſelf in ſecret: which I would beſeech you to conſider heartily, That as ſoon, yea, at the very firſt moment when a Soul is enrolled among the number of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at that inſtant he becomes a praying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41272:85"/>as in the caſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward called <hi>Paul.</hi> And let me ask you that attend on the Lord in publick Duties, what are you in ſecret? Does God uſually there hear from you? Cannot you live without ſeeing the face of God in ſecret? Let me tell you, publick Duties have many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; a man may deſire to be engaged in them from many baſe and bad ends; yea, it is poſſible natural Conſcience and your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation may carry you into corners ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: but therefore in ſecret how do you carry it? Doth it ſatisfie you that you have been in your Cloſets, and have ſpent it may be a quarter of an hour there, and it may be with a ſlight and formal Spirit? This is not the Spirit of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> But if thou art an <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite</hi> indeed, when thou art in ſecret thou wilt be fervent and earneſt with God. In pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Duties, a man may ſeem to be zealous, that he may get a Name, or keep up a Name that he hath gotten, or to ſome ſuch-like end; but when in ſecret the Soul cries mightily to the Lord, it is a good ſign that there is a ſenſe of want, and that it does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from a Spirit of Grace in the Soul, when thou canſt in ſecret ſign and mourn before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe things I have gone over with this deſign, to ſee if I could let you into a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41272:85"/>little Hope and good Ground, that as you have eſcaped, ſo you are eſcaping Iſraelites, who ſhall partake of Glory when Chriſt, the Branch of the Lord, ſhall be made glorious: And the Lord help you to be faithful to your Souls, and make you <hi>Iſraelites indeed, in whom is no guile.</hi>

                  <p>THis will lead me to a Second Uſe: If it be thus, that the Glory that ſhall come to Chriſt ſhall be for the good of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-<hi>Iſrael:</hi> Then methinks you ſhould ſay, Pray what will come to them that are not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though they do eſcape?</p>
                  <p>Ah wo to them! Dread and Terrour will be their portion. I tell you Souls, if any of you that are Eſcaping Ones this day, are not of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, there is dread enough behind to make your hearts tremble, though you have out-lived the preſent calamity. I confeſs I cannot well tell you what the dread of your Condition is; for the Spirit of God ſays, <hi>Job</hi> 31.3. <hi>Is not deſtruction to the Wicked, and a ſtrange puniſhment to the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity?</hi> The Spirit of God ſeems to ſay there ſhould fall upon the heads of the Ungodly things that ſhall be ſtrange in their very nature, things unthought of. Let me
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41272:86"/>tell you, though you are among the number of profeſſing Ones, and among them that are <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet if thou art not an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the hand of God will find thee out. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. when <hi>Babylons</hi> plagues are threatned, it is ſaid, verſ. 35. <hi>A Sword is upon the Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſaith the Lord;</hi> and then it is added, verſ. 37. <hi>A Sword is upon their Horſes and Chariots, and upon all the mingled People that are in the midſt of her.</hi> It is ſaid upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that there went with them a <hi>mixt multitude,</hi> there crowded among them ſome that were not the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God: Indeed I ſuppoſe it is ſuch a kind of People the Spirit of God here ſpeaks of. Poſſibly thou art mixed among Profeſſors, but thy heart is not right with God; God will find thee out, and his hand will deal with thee. What was falſly ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had eſcaped the Ship-wrack, and was come among the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, it is ſaid, <hi>A Viper came and faſtened upon his hand;</hi> and ſay they, <hi>No doubt this man is a Murderer, whom, though he hath eſcaped the Sea, yet Vengeance ſuffereth not to live:</hi> What the Barbarians falſly ſurmiſed, may be true concerning any of you; though you have eſcaped the ſlaughter of this day, the hand of God may find you out notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:41272:86"/>
                  <p>A few things, and but a few things, to ſhew you what the miſery of thoſe is like to be, who are not the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God indeed, though eſcaped for the preſent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt in the day of his Glory will cut them down, tread them down without number: The expreſſions of Scripture in this caſe muſt not be judged of according unto ſome of the Laws in our Land, which they ſay are made <hi>(in terrorem)</hi> onely to affright men, and it is not intended that the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them ſhall be inflicted on them; but whatſoever God hath ſaid concerning Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſhall be certainly executed: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3. <hi>I will tread down the People in my anger, and trample them in my fury;</hi> and the ſame you have again, verſ. 6. This is like to be the portion of thoſe that are eſcaped, and are not the Iſrael of God. The Book of <hi>Joel</hi> is a Prophecy relating to that time when Chriſt ſhall be glorious, verſ. 14. <hi>Multitudes in the Valley of Deciſion, for the Day of the Lord is near in the Valley of Deciſion:</hi> The day of the Lords Glory, it will be a ſlaughtering-day, and multitudes ſhall fall; and they are ſaid to fall in the Valley of Deciſion, becauſe at that time the Controverſie ſhall be decided that hath depended ſo long, Who are the Lords People, and who are for him, and who are owned of him indeed and in truth. You
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41272:87"/>read of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.14. <hi>And I looked, and behold a white Cloud, and upon the Cloud one ſat like unto the Son of Man, having on his head a golden Crown, and in his hand a ſharp Sickle:</hi> Chriſt when he ſhall come to wear his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Crown, he comes with a Sickle in his hand: Chriſt is reaping by every Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Slaughter he makes, and poſſibly you may out-live ſome Slaughters; but look on further, verſ. 17, 18, &amp;c. <hi>And another An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel came out of the Temple which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he alſo having a ſharp Sickle; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angel came out from the Altar, which had power over fire, and cried with a loud cry to him that had a ſharp Sickle, ſaying, Thruſt in thy ſharp Sickle, and gather the Cluſters of the Vine of the Earth, for her Grapes are fully ripe; and the Angel thruſt in his Sickle into the Earth, and gathered the Vine of the Earth, and caſt it into the great Wine-preſs of the Wrath of God; and the Wine-preſs was trodden without the City, and Blood came out of the Wine-preſs, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Horſes Bridles, by the ſpace of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſix hundred furlongs.</hi> The intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Scripture is to tell you what the dread of Earthly People ſhall be, they ſhall be cut down, and trodden down, and Blood ſhall come forth, even to the Horſes Bridles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the day of Chriſts Glory, they that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41272:87"/>are not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though they now eſcape, ſhall be cut down without reſpect of Sex or Age, without reſpect of greatneſs or contempt in the World; it is evident from the Word: In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.17, 18. you have a Prophecy concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Babylon</hi> of old, which is applicable to <hi>Babylon</hi> ſtill; <hi>Behold, I will ſtir up the Medes againſt them, which ſhall not regard Silver, and as for Gold they ſhall not delight in it; their Bows alſo ſhall daſh the young men to pieces, and they ſhall have no pity on the fruit of the Womb, their eye ſhall not ſpare Children:</hi> It does inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to us at what rate Chriſt will act, when he comes out againſt them that are none of his; he will neither ſpare nor pity, have no reſpect to young or old, nor ſhall mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high or low be ought of defence or ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to him, <hi>The day of the Lord ſhall be upon the Cedars of Lebanon, and upon the Oaks of Baſhan, and upon all the high Mountains:</hi> the Great Ones of the World ſhall feel the dread of that ſtroke.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Diſtreſs ſhall attend them within and without, <hi>Job</hi> 15.20, 21. <hi>The Wicked travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with pain all his days, and a dreadful ſound is in his Ears;</hi> the <hi>dreadful ſound</hi> is the pangs of their own Conſciences, being filled with terror. And this ſhall be the portion of the World, they ſhall be filled with dreadful ſounds, terrors within; and alſo miſeries
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41272:88"/>ſhall compaſs them about in every thing, and in every way: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19. it is ſaid concerning <hi>Egypt, They ſhall erre in every work, and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as a drunken man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Miſeries ſhall be recompenced upon them ſuitable to the violence done to the Saints, the diſhonour brought to God, and the abuſing of all the patience and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt towards them; three ſad ſcores that ſhall be reckoned for in the day of Chriſt. Thoſe that are not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though they eſcape for a time, they ſhall be dealt withall according to the violence done to the Saints of God: <hi>The violence done to me and to my Fleſh, be upon Babylon, ſhall the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Zion ſay. Iſa.</hi> 51.22, 23. <hi>I have taken the cup of trembling out of thy hand</hi> (that is, out of <hi>Zions</hi> hand) <hi>even the dregs of the cup of my fury, thou ſhalt no more drink it again; but I will put it into the hand of them that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict thee, which have ſaid to thy Soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and thou haſt laid thy Body as the ground, and as the ſtreet to them that went over.</hi> They ſhall ſuffer too accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the contempt of the Goſpel, and the diſhonour done to Chriſt that way; for he ſhall come to deal with all them that do not know him, and obey not the Goſpel; and alſo according to the ſin of deſpiſing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of Chriſt. Indeed this day you are
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41272:88"/>eſcaped, and the patience of Chriſt is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed towards you, but let me tell you, if you ſtand and abide in your ſinful ſtate, you ſhall find that the abuſing of the patience of Chriſt, is but <hi>treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>HAving diſpatch'd the Second, I come now to a Third Uſe, (which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Uſes neceſſarily lead unto.) It is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to encourage the hearts of poor Sinners, that poſſibly may be full of thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that they might yet be brought into the number of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Methinks I do even hear ſome poor heart ſay, <hi>If it be ſo well with them that are Gods Iſrael, and ſo ill with them that are not Gods Iſrael; What is there no hope for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41272:89"/>me, though I am yet none of that number? Muſt I for ever ſtay in that ſtate of miſery in which I am? Muſt an eternal doom of Miſery be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taild upon me? I acknowledge my ſtate is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding deſperate and ſad; but is there no hope in Iſrael concerning this matter?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer:</p>
                  <p>If there be any poor ſinner ſenſible of the miſery of his condition, that would gladly make an eſcape out of it; Soul, be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, thy condition is not hopeleſs; but be encouraged, for there is a poſſibility that as thou haſt eſcaped the dread and miſery of this preſent day, ſo thou mayſt be delivered from that Chriſtleſs ſtate wherein thou art. There are two Scriptures I would commend to you for this purpoſe; the firſt is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.5. <hi>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords: and another ſhall call himſelf by the Name of Jacob: and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord, and ſirname himſelf by the Name of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> The words are both a Prophecy and a Promiſe, and they do reſpect the Gentile-World, that were at that time, and long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in their ſins, in their ſtate of eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God; here it is propheſied that yet there ſhould be a flocking into <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the number of Gods Iſrael ſhould be greatly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41272:89"/>augmented and encreaſed: It is promiſed that God would ſo prevail upon the hearts of ſome poor Sinners that they ſhall come and ſay, <hi>I am the Lords: and ſhall come and ſubſcribe their hands to the Lord, and ſhall ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name themſelves by the Name of Iſrael:</hi> that God would conquer them ſo far that they ſhould ſee the need they had to be of that number, that they ſhall reſign and give up themſelves to be of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. This is an encouraging word to the Sinner; there is a poſſibility for them that were ſtrangers to come and to name themſelves by the Name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſubſcribing to the Lord, to take up that Name, and ſo partake of the Priviledges of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>Take another Scripture: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.24, 25. <hi>In that day ſhall Iſrael be the third with Egypt and with Aſſyria, even a Bleſſing in the midſt of the Land; whom the Lord of Hoſts ſhall bleſs, ſaying, Bleſſed be Egypt my People, and Aſſyria the Work of my hands, and Iſrael my Inheritance.</hi> The import of the words is this, <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria</hi> were ſome of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of God and his People, at a very great diſtance from him; but here is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that they ſhould come to be conquered, and brought into ſubjection to the Lord, and to be baptized into the Spirit of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be bleſſed with the Bleſſing of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they ſhall
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41272:90"/>ſpeak the Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they ſhall be of one Heart and one Lip with the Lords People. Souls, were you as <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were you as the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> Enemies to God and his People; were you at the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God that could be ſuppoſed; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> had neither Ordinances nor Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, nor ought elſe that good was, more then the creatures of the Earth, and ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like things; yet the Lord intimates here to us, that they ſhall come to ſhare in and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Bleſſing with <hi>Iſrael.</hi> If thy eſtate were as one of them, yet mayeſt thou, as and according to the promiſe made to them, be brought into the number that ſhall ſhare in the Bleſſing of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Soul, though now thou art not of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet it may be ſaid to thee, <hi>They have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mercy which had not obtained.</hi> This is the kindneſs of God, that he is pleaſed to make bleſſed overtures of Mercy unto poor, vile, and unworthy Sinners. But more then this, for the encouragement of any Soul that may yet be in his Sins, I would ſpeak four or five things: Thy condition is not deſperate, but thou mayſt be brought into the number of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and ſo partake of the ſame Mercy with them in thy eſcaping this day, if thou doſt conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to be the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41272:90"/>of God by choice, and through the Grace and Goodneſs of God: <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not born the People of God: He choſe <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed from the reſt of the World, to be a peculiar People to himſelf.

Choice it is a free Act, in which there is no neceſſity and conſtraint; ſo it was in God a free Act to pitch upon Iſrael, to make them his People: This account the Lord gives of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37. <hi>And becauſe he loved thy Fathers, therefore he CHOSE their Seed after them, and brought thee out in his ſight with mighty power:</hi> ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE you, becauſe you were more in number then any People, for ye were the feweſt of all People; but becauſe the Lord loved you,</hi> &amp;c. At firſt God did out of his meer accord chuſe <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, and having in love choſen them, he continues his kindneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, that he might keep his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and his Mercy that he promiſed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:41272:91"/>Poor Soul, this I would now ſay to thee: <hi>Iſrael</hi> was found out by the Lords Grace, and that Grace may alſo fix upon thee: It was not any thing that was in <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> but meerly the good pleaſure of God that choſe them to be his People, and the ſame Grace of God may chuſe thee, and plant thee among his People, and give thee with them a pleaſant portion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When God firſt choſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he found them in as wretched and ſad a condition as thine can be; thy caſe cannot be worſe then the caſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was when the Love and Grace of God fixed upon them: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord to Jeruſalem, Thy Birth and thy Nativity is of the Land of Canaan; thy Father was an Amorite and thy Mother a Hittite. Canaan</hi> were a People originally without the knowledge of God, in their enmity againſt God: This, ſays God, was <hi>Iſrael</hi> when firſt I found them; without the knowledge of God, and at as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God as perſons could be: Let the Devil ſay the worſt againſt thee that he can, he can but ſay thou art by nature at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God, filled with all the Principles of Sin, and ſo was <hi>Iſrael</hi> as well as thou: and that Grace that yet pitied <hi>Iſrael</hi> in this his low eſtate, can alſo reach thy Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Iſrael</hi> when firſt God did him good
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41272:91"/>was in as hopeleſs and helpleſs a condition as thine can be: So he goes on, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>And as for thy Nativity, in the day thou waſt born, thy Navel was not cut, neither waſt thou waſhed in water to ſupple thee; thou waſt not ſalted at all, nor ſwadled at all, none Eye pitied thee to do any of theſe unto thee, to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon thee, but thou waſt caſt out in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen field to the loathing of thy perſon in the day that thou waſt born.</hi> What is more helpleſs and ſhiftleſs then an Infant juſt taken from the Womb, not able to do its ſelf the leaſt ſervice? This was <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s condition when the Lord firſt found them, not in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of moving one ſtep out of that wretched, ſinful, corrupt, and rebellious ſtate. And truly to this day the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered, are altogether unable to act for God and his Glory, but as they are aſſiſted with power from on high. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24, 25. <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I Righteouſneſs and Strength: even to him ſhall men come, and all that are incenſed againſt him ſhall be aſhamed. In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory. Iſrael</hi> in their beſt ſtate cannot glory in themſelves, nor in any ſtrength of their own, but muſt look upon themſelves as weak Creatures, onely as they are ſtrengthened by the Lord unto any good Word and Work. Soul, this
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41272:92"/>I would ſay, Thou canſt but be a ſhiftleſs, helpleſs Creature, unable to move a foot forward, or to further thy own Everlaſting Concernments in the leaſt; and this is to be in no worſe ſtate then God found his own People in, and that Grace by which they were brought near to God, can and may alſo work for the good of thy Soul.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider further, That the very ſame Promiſes of Mercy are made unto poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to this day; Promiſes of a part in thoſe very good things which <hi>Iſrael</hi> is poſſeſſed of. All the bleſſings of the Covenant are freely offered and tendred to Sinners to this hour: Hence are all the gracious Promiſes made to the Gentiles up and down the Word of Truth, of which you have more then a few. The firſt of which (as I ſuppoſe) is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. <hi>God ſhall enlarge Japheth, and he ſhall dwell in the Tents of Shem, and Canaan ſhall be his Servant:</hi> This is the firſt Promiſe ever made to the Gentiles, and ſome render the word <hi>(Deus alliciet Japhethum) God ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure or perſwade Japheth, and he ſhall dwell in the Tents of Shem: Japheth</hi> is put for the Gentile-World; for by him the Iſles of the Gentiles were inhabited, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.2. and 5. compared. You ſhall find if you look in <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.36. and downward, Chriſt was of the Race of <hi>Shem;</hi> and the import of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41272:92"/>is this, When God ſays he will <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded Japheth to dwell in the Tents of Shem;</hi> he means he will overcome the hearts of the Sinners among the Gentiles, to come to an amity and friendſhip with Jeſus Chriſt; as co-habitation denotes amity, and it is a word full of Grace and Favour as it can hold. But more plain and full is that word, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, for it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree; that the Bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It was the deſign both of the Father and the Son, that all the Bleſſings of the death of Chriſt ſhould reach unto the Sinners among the Gentiles, that what ever Bleſſing was promiſed firſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; unto his Seed, the ſame Bleſſing alſo ſhould be made over and given in to every poor ſinner among the Gentiles, that ſhall come and ſubmit themſelves unto the Lord Jeſus. Well then, Is not this greatly for thy comfort? If thou ſayeſt, I am not <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet here is room and way made for thee: It is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment both of Father and Son to let in thy Soul into all the Bleſſings and Mercies promiſed unto the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider this alſo, poor Sinner, if thou art yet in thy ſin and eſtrangement from
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41272:93"/>God, That it is the real deſign and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, both in the Judgement that thou haſt ſeen, and the Eſcape thou haſt had in and under theſe Calamities, to bring thee among the number of his own People. What is the deſign of God in all his Controverſies with the World? It is to bring them to kiſs the Son: the great Controverſie is, That People will not take the Yoke of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and therefore ſometimes he drives, ſometimes he draws, and all means he uſes, that he may overcome the hearts of poor Sinners: See the goodneſs he ſhews, the mercy he follows them with, in ſparing and preſerving them, it is to this great end, That his goodneſs might lead them to repentance, and to a real ſubjection to the Lord Jeſus. Therefore Soul, though thou haſt ſtood long in ways of Rebellion againſt Chriſt, yet the Bleſſings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtand open for thee, and the Door of Grace is wide open; be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent if thou doſt enter in, cloſe with, and accept of Grace, it will be as well with thee as with any of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Conſider thy hearty cloſing with Chriſt will not onely let thee into Mercy and Bleſſing of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Day, but it will let thee into Bleſſings of all kinds; it will bring a Bleſſing upon thee in every Work and Way; it will let thee into a part and ſhare in the higheſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41272:93"/>that the Children of Men are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of: it will let thee into Sonſhip and Friendſhip with the great and holy God: it will make thee bleſſed for Time and for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Therefore fight not againſt thy own Mercies; mind really and heartily what freeneſs and heartineſs there is in the great God, in ſetting before ſinners all the Grace of the Covenant, and what gladneſs it doth produce when poor Souls are willing to kiſs the Son; it will not onely produce Joy in thy own Soul, it will not onely make glad the hearts of many of thy Relations and of thy Friends, (for poſſibly thou haſt Relations and Friends that long to ſee Chriſt formed in thee, that in every petition at the Throne of Grace their hearts are working for thy Soul, and begging that thou mayſt be a plant of Righteouſneſs of the Lords own planting, and nothing would glad them more then to ſee thee a Son and Heir of the Kingdom of God) but alſo there will be Joy in Heaven; Father, Son, and Spirit are gladded to ſee the deſigns of the death of Chriſt graciouſly accompliſhed upon the hearts of poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Remember therefore, I do this day in the Name of Chriſt invite thee to partake of all the Mercies which be the Mercies of Gods <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And truly the Mercies of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> are many; there is Pardon, there is Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41272:94"/>there is Adoption, Sonſhip, there is the Spirit to comfort you, to lead you in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work and way; there be the Promiſes made over to them, there is mercy now and for ever; A Kingdom the Lord has prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them that love him: I invite thee to take a part in theſe things this day, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it not, that thou haſt had a Call from the Lord at this time. Soul, I tell thee, if thou doſt ſtand it out againſt this Call of God, truly though thou art eſcaped, and thy life is given thee for a prey, yet thou maiſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſealed up unto deſtruction, thou maiſt be left to dye in thy ſins, and to fall for ever under the weight of divine diſpleaſure, for thy neglect and contempt of Goſpel-Grace. Be confident as Jeſus Chriſt is now waiting upon poor Souls, and offering Mercy to poor Sinners; ſo when he comes to the glory that is reſerved for him, he will be found of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſufficient to recompence all that have trodden under foot the Blood of the Son of God, and made light of thoſe overtures of Mercy that have been tendred to them. The Light is now with thee, and the Lord is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thee; therefore make peace while thou art in the way, leſt the Lord come forth againſt thee in his hot diſpleaſure.</p>

                        <p>It is true, the Election of God is a ſecret in the heart of God, and ſecret things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto God; things written and revealed belong to us: It is not for me or thee to climb Heaven to ſearch Records, and at firſt daſh to turn over the leaves of the Book of Life, and to ſee whether we may find our Names therein written. It is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake upon which many run, that would think to prove the truth of their being called, by finding out whether they are elected or no; it is an endleſs, it is an impoſſible work. This therefore know is thy work and mine, to conſult what effects of Electing Love we can finde upon our Souls; if any thing of that be in thy heart, thence thou mayſt ſafely conclude thou waſt in the heart of <hi>God</hi> from Eternity. There is a Scripture that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41272:95"/>anſwers fully (I think) whatever the Soul can ſay in this matter, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Brethren, beloved, your Election of God; for our Goſpel came not unto you in word but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in power, and in the holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your ſake.</hi> Conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Goſpel hath had its work upon thy heart, whether it hath come with power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Soul; and if ſo, others may know, and thou mayſt know from thence thine Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Election is an act of God that he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from Eternity, but Calling is a work and Fruit of Election upon the Soul of a poor Sinner, by which it may come to diſcover that it was in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the World was laid. If therefore thou canſt trace the footſteps of Gods going upon thy Soul, and of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Goſpel-way upon thy heart, thy Soul is ſafe, and the thoughts of God (thou mayſt conclude) were towards thee before thou hadſt a being.

                        <p>As it is a work of the Goſpel to cleanſe and purifie the heart, ſo it is not all the work it does, nor is it the firſt work it doth, nor the work that is firſt manifeſt upon the Soul. The Law it humbles the ſinner, and makes him ſee his need of Chriſt: the firſt work of the Goſpel is to give the ſinner hope that he may be delivered out of his undone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and the next is, to make him willing to ſubject to and accept of the Grace of God in the Goſpel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the day of thy Power.</hi> Therefore Soul, if thou doſt make this Objection, this I would ſay to thee; Conſider whether thou canſt find that the Goſpel hath done its firſt work upon thy heart, hath made thee willing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41272:96"/>to accept of Grace in the Goſpel-way, and to bow and fall at the foot of Jeſus Chriſt.

Be not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily thus deluded: but if thou haſt ought that may be really a ſolid ground of hope to thee, do not eaſily caſt away thy confidence; but having got a little hold, keep it, that thou art ſpared in mercy, and ſhalt find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy when Chriſt ſhall appear glorious.</p>

                  <p>THe Fifth Uſe will be to them that are the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, to comfort their hearts: and this Doctrine that is under conſideration, is exceeding comfortable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch; I may truly ſay to them, I do bring them <hi>glad tidings of great Joy.</hi> What! ſhall all the ſad and diſmal Slaughters made in the World, work to ſuch a bleſſed iſſue as the Exaltation of Chriſt? And ſhall all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be for your good? What can you wiſh for more? When <hi>David</hi> had been ſpeaking of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and his Glory, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Perſon of <hi>Solomon,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. it is ſaid, <hi>The Prayers of David the Son of Jeſſe are ended:</hi> The ſum of all that a gracious heart can deſire, is, That Chriſt may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; when that is done, he knows not what
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41272:99"/>more to pray for. If you are <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and your hearts are as they ſhould be, the great thing about which your Spirits are working, is, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be ſet upon his Throne, and that his Name may be exalted: If this work go forward, and be in hand, the work that is in hand and goes on, is that which lies moſt upon your hearts, and in which your <hi>Souls</hi> have greateſt occaſion to rejoyce. Let the conſideration of this, comfort you,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Againſt whatever Breaches may have been made upon you by this day of ſlaughter; it will be ſtrange if ſome of you have not loſt Friends and Relations: Remember all theſe Breaches made upon you, onely ſerve to repair the intereſt of Chriſt, and work for his glory: and if your hearts be right, what would you not part with, ſo the work of God may be furthered? If your hearts be right, you will ſay, <hi>Let all go, and come what will; if Chriſt may but be a Gainer, I will be willing all things ſhould be loſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let it comfort you under thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, and troubles, and dread, that it may be, hath been upon your Spirits in ſuch a day: Doubtleſs Times of ſlaughter are Times of great ſorrow and grief of heart; but who would not ſuſtain a little grief, for the working out of greater comfort? The firſt ſight that you ſhall have of Chriſt in his
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41272:100"/>glory, will wipe away theſe Tears, and will ſuppreſs all thoſe Fears; it will make them be as if they had never been.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let it comfort you, if you ſhould ſee worſe things then ever yet you have ſeen. I do believe many Souls do this day think that nothing can be more terrible then what they have already ſeen and heard; but if they ſhould be miſtaken, and you ſhould ſee things more dreadful, be comforted; Chriſts work is going forward, his glory and <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s mercy is upon the wheel. It is not unuſual in Scripture and experience, that one Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment goes not alone, but it is followed by others cloſely at the heels. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.12. <hi>When they faſt, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer Burnt-Offering &amp; an Oblation, I will not accept them: but I will conſume them by the Sword, and by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence:</hi> Not one ſingle Judgement one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but others were to go in hand along with it. Chriſt ſays, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.25, 26. That a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the day of his glory, there ſhall be <hi>diſtreſs of Nations, and mens hearts ſhall fail them for fear, for looking after thoſe things that are coming on the Earth.</hi> It is a very probable conjecture, that as we have ſeen the diſtreſs of a City, we may ſee the diſtreſs of Nations, and troubles may over-ſpread the face of the whole Earth. Yet if theſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41272:100"/>things ſhould be, remember Chriſts Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to his own Diſciples, verſ. 28. <hi>Look up, and lift up your heads, for your Redemption draweth nigh.</hi> Remember the words of the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Be not afraid with ſudden fear, neither with the deſolation of the Wicked when it comes; for the Lord ſhall be thy confidence, and ſhall keep thy foot from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be comforted though you cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the method of God, and are not able to conceive how theſe Diſpenſations of God ſhould work for Chriſts glory, and the good of his People: We are apt to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed becauſe we cann't ſee into the depths of the proceedings of God, and underſtand the reaſon of them all. But remember he that hath the management of theſe things knows his own ends, and can tell how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his own deſigns, and he will be ſure to do his own work, when all men have done what they can: Things may and ſhall work for the good of the Saints, though we cannot underſtand them. Remember the caſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 42.36. Says <hi>Jacob, Me ye have bereaved of my Children; Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not, and will you take away Benjamin alſo? All theſe things are againſt me.</hi> To his apprehenſion all this made againſt him; when in truth, and when the iſſue was
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41272:101"/>ſeen, it made ſo for him as nothing could do more. And thus it is in the great ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Diſpenſations of God with which we are ſtartled; though we underſtand not the myſtery and reaſon of Gods proceedings, yet they make for the good of his People, and will work out his glory, though we cry theſe things are againſt us often-times.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And laſtly, It will comfort you if you are <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though you ſhould not ſee all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed immediately, though the Branch of the Lord ſhould not forthwith become glorious; Remember Faith and Patience, they ſerve to help us to wait and ſtay Gods time and leiſure. God always keeps his Ends upon his Heart, and in his Eye, and never acts in any inconſiſtency with them. This is abundantly certain, that he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh every good thing for his People: <hi>Wait therefore on the Lord, and keep his Way, and he will exalt you in due time.</hi> Though he anſwers your deſires and expectations, for the preſent, by <hi>terrible things,</hi> yet it is <hi>in Righteouſneſs,</hi> and it is for the bringing about whatever mercy he promiſed to his People.</p>

How ſhould the ſence of it over-come your Souls! To be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and preſerved in mercy, to great and glorious ends, what can you deſire more had you been put to make your own terms with God? Believe it, if you are the Lords People in truth, you are much in the heart of God, and your Good in the very next place to his own and his Sons Glory is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, however he deals with you: If he lets looſe men upon you, it is not with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to hurt you; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.12. <hi>Thou haſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men to ride over our heads, we went through fire and water; but thou haſt brought us out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a wealthy place.</hi> If he comes to thunder down Judgements upon the World, it is with a deſign to do you good; it is for your ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.14. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the holy One of Iſrael, For your ſakes I have ſent to Babylon, and have brought down all their Nobles; and the Caldeans, whoſe cry is in the Ships.</hi> Chriſt in all his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in all the Diſpenſations of his Kingly Power from firſt to laſt, aims at the good of his People, and it is for their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that he acts, however we are apt through blindneſs and ignorance to interpret it. If
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41272:102"/>he cuts down his People, it is to do them good; if he ſpares them it is becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in them, and will make them partake of ſparing-mercy. How admirable is the kindneſs of the Lord, and what effect ſhould it have? But</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To teach you to ſee the hand of Chriſt in all, and to ſing forth the praiſes of the Lord; your preſervation is through Chriſt. When the Paſſeover was inſtituted of old, God bid the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to <hi>ſprinkle the Blood of the Lamb upon the door poſts, and when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel paſſed by to ſlay the firſt-born of Egypt, he would paſs by their doors that were ſprinkled:</hi> If the deſtroying Angel hath paſſed by your Doors, and hath not come in, it is becauſe your poſt was ſprinkled with the Blood of Jeſus, the Blood of the Lamb: It is to <hi>Chriſt</hi> that you own it, and O that the praiſes of the Lord might be ſounded forth by you: in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.3. God is ſaid to <hi>inhabit the Praiſes of Iſrael;</hi> it is a remarkable expreſſion, <hi>O Thou that inhabiteſt the Praiſes of Iſrael, our Fathers truſted in thee, and were delivered. Iſrael</hi> ſhould be a praiſing People, and God delights in their Praiſes: He loves to be where his Praiſes are ſpoken forth. O that your habitations might be the habitations where the Praiſes of God might dwell, and where the goodneſs of God may be ſounded forth.</p>

There be great engagements lie upon our Souls that we live up to this expectation of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Surely your work is to help forward the glory of Chriſt and your own good, by all ways you can: Faith and Prayer are the great means by which you may be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this great end. We are apt to be faithleſs and unbelieving, when things ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not according to our deſire and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation; but the work of the Soul is, to wait for the ſalvation of God, and to believe for the accompliſhment of all that the Lord hath ſpoken; to beg earneſtly that God would remember his Promiſe, that he would
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41272:103"/>do according to the Faith of his People: Whatſoever God has engaged himſelf to his People, that he will do for them, he expects that they ſhould enquire of him for it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How much ought it to be your care to be found in a ſpirit fit to meet Chriſt in his glory? There is great talk in the World of what expectations are upon the hearts of the Saints; O that we could ſee ſuitable prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in every Soul, putting off the works of darkneſs, and preſſing after a Spirit of Humility and Holineſs, that we might be crucified to the World, and raiſed up to a ſpiritual frame: the day of Chriſts glory will be exceedingly filled up with ſpiritual things, and a carnal earthly ſpirit will be loathed and abominable. O then ſhake off the filth of ſin, and the filth of this World, and put on your beautiful Garments, that ſo you may be prepared to meet the Lord in his glory.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Do you much pity Sinners: When Chriſt ſhall come in his glory, with what ſhame and confuſion will poor ſinners ſtand? every heart will tremble, and the proudeſt ſpirit will then ſtoop. O pity them now, for then you will have no pity for them: the Righteous ſhall rejoyce when he ſees the vengeance, they will then onely triumph in the righteous Diſpenſations of God. O pity
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41272:103"/>them now, and mourn over them, and pray for them, and pray them into Chriſt, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and walk ſo before them that thou maiſt make them in love with the ways of God: This is your work, the Salvation of Sinners ſhould be much upon your hearts, if you know the worth of your own Souls: And the more there are brought into Chriſt, the greater will the ſolemnity be, and the glory of this glorious appearance.</p>
                  <p>To cloſe all therefore:</p>
